			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>1) Great strides have been made in the digital age, but 
one of the pressing issues yet to be addressed is how we, as individuals and as 
an ecclesial community, are to live in the digital world as &#8220;loving neighbours&#8221; 
who are genuinely present and attentive to each other on our common journey 
along the &#8220;digital highways&#8221;. </p>
			<p>Advancements in technology have made new kinds of human interactions possible. 
In fact, the question is no longer whether to engage with the digital world, but 
how. Social media in particular is an environment where people interact, share 
experiences, and cultivate relationships unlike ever before. At the same time, 
however, as communication is increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence, 
there arises the need to rediscover the human encounter at its very core. Over 
the last two decades, our relationship with digital platforms has undergone an 
irreversible transformation. An awareness has emerged that these platforms can 
evolve to become co-created spaces, not just something that we passively use. 
Young people &#8211; as well as older generations &#8211; are asking to be met where they 
are, including on social media, because the digital world is &#8220;a significant part 
of young people&#8217;s identity and way of life.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref1" title href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
			<p>2) Many Christians are asking for inspiration and 
guidance since social media, which is one expression of digital culture, has had 
a profound impact on both our faith communities and our individual spiritual 
journeys. </p>
			<p>Examples of faithful and creative engagement on social media abound around the 
world, from both local communities as well as individuals who give witness to 
their faith on these platforms, oftentimes more pervasively than the 
institutional Church. There are also numerous pastoral and educational 
initiatives developed by local Churches, movements, communities, congregations, 
universities, and individuals. </p>
			<p>3)     The universal Church has also addressed the digital 
reality. Since 1967, for example, the yearly World Communications Day messages 
have offered an ongoing reflection on the topic.  Beginning in the 1990s, these 
messages addressed the use of the computer and since the early 2000s, they have 
consistently reflected on aspects of digital culture and social communication. 
Raising fundamental questions for digital culture, 
			<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/messages/communications/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20090124_43rd-world-communications-day.html">Pope Benedict XVI, in 2009</a>, addressed the shifts in patterns of communication, saying that media should not 
only foster connections between people but also encourage them to commit 
themselves to relationships that promote &#8220;a culture of respect, dialogue and 
friendship.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref2" title href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Subsequently, the 
Church consolidated the image of social media as &#8220;spaces&#8221;, not only &#8220;tools&#8221;, and 
called for the Good News to be proclaimed also in digital environments<a name="_ftnref3" title href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> For his part, Pope Francis has acknowledged that the digital world is 
&#8220;indistinguishable from the sphere of everyday life,&#8221; and it is changing the way 
humanity accumulates knowledge, disseminates information, and develops 
relationships.<a name="_ftnref4" title href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>4)     In addition to these reflections, the Church&#8217;s 
practical engagement with social media has also been effective.<a name="_ftnref5" title href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> One recent moment clearly demonstrated that digital media is a powerful 
tool for the Church&#8217;s ministry. 
			<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/events/event.dir.html/content/vaticanevents/en/2020/3/27/uniti-in-preghiera.html">On 27 March 2020</a>, while still in the early 
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Saint Peter&#8217;s Square was empty but full of 
presence. A televised and live-streamed transmission allowed Pope Francis to 
lead a transformative global experience: a prayer and message addressed to a 
world in lockdown. In the midst of a health crisis that took the lives of 
millions, people around the world, quarantined and in isolation, found 
themselves profoundly united with each other and with the successor of Peter.<a name="_ftnref6" title href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
			<p>Through traditional media and digital technology, the Pope&#8217;s prayer reached the 
homes and touched the lives of people all over the world. The open arms of 
Bernini&#8217;s colonnade around the square were able to extend an embrace to 
millions. Though physically distant from each other, those who joined the Pope 
in that hour were present to one another and could experience a moment of unity 
and communion. </p>
			<p> </p>

			<p> </p>
			<p>5)     The following pages are the result of a reflection 
involving experts, teachers, young professionals and leaders, lay persons, 
clergy, and religious. The aim is to address some of the main questions 
involving how Christians should engage social media. They are not meant to be 
precise &#8220;guidelines&#8221; for pastoral ministry in this area. The hope, instead, is 
to promote a common reflection about our digital experiences, encouraging both 
individuals and communities to take a creative and constructive approach that 
can foster a culture of neighbourliness. </p>
			<p>The challenge of fostering peaceful, meaningful, and caring relationships on 
social media prompts a discussion in academic and professional circles, as well 
as in ecclesial ones. What kind of humanity is reflected in our presence in 
digital environments? How much of our digital relationships is the fruit of deep 
and truthful communication, and how much is merely shaped by unquestioned 
opinions and passionate reactions? How much of our faith finds living and 
refreshing digital expressions? And who is my &#8220;neighbour&#8221; on social media? </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p align="center">***</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>6)     The Parable of the Good Samaritan<a name="_ftnref7" title href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, 
by which Jesus makes us answer the question, &#8220;Who is my neighbour?&#8221;, is prompted 
by the question of an expert in the law. &#8220;What must I do to <i>inherit</i> 
eternal life?&#8221;, he asks. The verb &#8220;to inherit&#8221; reminds us of the <i>heritage</i> 
of the promised land, which is not so much a geographical territory, but a 
symbol of something more profound and lasting, something that every generation 
has to rediscover and that can help us to reimagine our role within the digital 
world.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>                                
&nbsp;</p>
			<p>                                
<font color="#663300"><b>I.     Watching out for pitfalls on the digital highways 
</b> 
<i><br>
Learning to see from the perspective of the one who fell into the hands of 
robbers (cf. Lk 10:36). </i></font> </p>
			<p><b>A promised land to rediscover? </b> </p>
			<p>7)     Social media is only one branch of the much broader 
and more complex phenomenon of <i>digitization</i>, which is the process of 
transferring many tasks and dimensions of human life to digital platforms. 
Digital technologies can increase our efficiency, boost our economy, and help us 
solve previously insurmountable problems. The digital revolution extended our 
access to information and our ability to connect with one another beyond the 
limitations of physical space. A process that was already taking place over the 
past three decades was accelerated by the pandemic. Activities, such as 
education and work, that were normally carried out in person can now be done at 
a distance. Countries also made significant changes in their legal and 
legislative systems, adopting online sessions and voting as an alternative to 
meeting in person. The rapid pace with which information spreads is also 
changing how politics operate. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>8)     With the advent of Web 5.0 and other communication 
advances, the role of artificial intelligence in the years to come will 
increasingly impact our experience of reality. We are witnessing the development 
of machines that work and make decisions for us; that can learn and predict our 
behaviors; sensors on our skin that can measure our emotions; machines that 
answer our questions and learn from our answers or that use the registers of 
irony and speak with the voice and expressions of those who are no longer with 
us. In this ever evolving reality, many questions remain to be answered.<a name="_ftnref8" title href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> 
			</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>9)     The remarkable changes that the world has experienced 
since the emergence of the Internet have also prompted new tensions. Some were 
born into this culture and are &#8220;digital natives&#8221;; others are still trying to get 
used to it as &#8220;digital immigrants.&#8221; In any case, our culture is now a digital 
culture. To overcome the old dichotomy between &#8220;digital&#8221; versus &#8220;face to face&#8221;, 
some no longer speak of &#8220;online&#8221; versus &#8220;offline&#8221; but only of &#8220;<i>onlife</i>&#8221;, 
incorporating human and social life in its various expressions, be they in 
digital or physical spaces. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>10)  In the context of integrated communication, consisting of the 
convergence of communication processes, social media plays a decisive role as a 
forum in which our values, beliefs, language, and assumptions about daily life 
are shaped. Moreover, for many people, especially those in developing countries, the only 
contact with digital communication is through social media. Well beyond the act 
of <i>using </i>social media as a tool, we are<i> living</i> in an ecosystem 
shaped at its core by the experience of social sharing. While we still <i>use
</i>the web to search for information or entertainment, we turn to social media 
for a sense of belonging and affirmation, transforming it into a vital space 
where the communication of core values and beliefs takes place.</p>
			<p>In this ecosystem, people are asked to trust in the authenticity of the mission 
statements of social media companies, which promise, for example, to bring the 
world closer together, to give everyone the power to create and share ideas, or 
to give everyone a voice. Although we are conscious of the fact that these 
advertising slogans are almost never put into practice since companies are much 
more concerned with their profits, we still tend to believe the promises.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>11)  Indeed, when people began to utilize the Internet a few decades ago, 
they were already sharing a version of this dream: the hope that the digital 
world would be a happy space of common understanding, free information, and 
collaboration. The Internet was to be a &#8220;promised land&#8221; where people could rely 
on information shared on the basis of transparency, trust, and expertise.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Pitfalls to avoid</b></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>12)  These expectations, however, were not exactly met. </p>
			<p>First of all, we are still dealing with a &#8220;digital divide&#8221;. While this evolution 
is moving faster than our capabilities to understand it properly, many people 
still lack access not only to basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, 
housing and health care, but also to information communication technologies. 
This leaves a great number of the marginalized stranded on the roadside. </p>
			<p>Besides that, a &#8220;social media divide&#8221; is becoming ever more acute. Platforms 
that promise to build community and bring the world closer together have instead 
deepened various forms of division. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>13)  There are a few pitfalls to be aware of on the &#8220;digital highway,&#8221; 
which allow us to understand betterhow this could happen. </p>
			<p>Today it is not possible to talk about &#8220;social media&#8221; without considering its 
commercial value, that is, without the awareness that the actual revolution 
occurred when brands and institutions realized the strategic potential of social 
platforms, contributing to a rapid consolidation of languages and practices that 
over the years transformed <i>users</i> into <i>consumers</i>. Additionally, 
individuals are both <i>consumers</i> and <i>commodities</i>: as consumers, they 
are presented with <i>data-driven advertising</i> and sponsored content in a 
tailor-made way. As commodities, their profiles and data are sold to other 
businesses with the same end in mind. By adhering to the mission statements of 
social media companies, people also accept &#8220;terms of agreement&#8221; that they 
usually do not read or understand. It has become popular to understand these 
&#8220;terms of agreement&#8221; according to an old adage that says, &#8220;<i>If you are not 
paying for it, you are the product</i>&#8221;. In other words, it is not free: we are 
paying with minutes of our attention and bytes of our data. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>14)  Increasing emphasis on the distribution and trade of knowledge, data, 
and information has generated a paradox: in a society where information plays 
such an essential role, it is increasingly difficult to verify sources and the 
accuracy of the information that circulates digitally. Content overload is 
solved by artificial intelligence algorithms that constantly determine what to 
show us based on factors that we hardly perceive or realize: not only our 
previous choices, likes, reactions or preferences, but also our absences and 
distractions, pauses, and attention spans. The digital environment that each 
person sees &#8211; and even the results of an online search &#8211; is never the same as 
that of someone else. By searching for information on browsers, or receiving it 
in our feed for different platforms and applications, we are usually not aware 
of the filters that condition the results. The consequence of this increasingly 
sophisticated personalization of results is a forced exposure to partial 
information, which corroborates our own ideas, reinforces our beliefs, and thus 
leads us into an isolation of &#8220;<i>filter bubbles&#8221;</i>.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>15)  Online communities on social media are &#8220;meeting points,&#8221; usually 
shaped around the shared interests of &#8220;networked individuals&#8221;. Those present on 
social media are addressed according to their particular characteristics, 
origins, tastes, and preferences, as the algorithms behind online platforms and 
search engines tend to bring those who are &#8220;sames&#8221; together, grouping them and 
drawing their attention in order to keep them online. Consequently, social media 
platforms can run the risk of preventing their users from really meeting the 
&#8220;other&#8221; who is different. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>16)  We have all witnessed automated systems that risk creating these 
individualistic &#8220;spaces,&#8221; and at times encouraging extreme behaviors. Aggressive 
and negative speeches are easily and rapidly spread, offering a fertile field 
for violence, abuse, and misinformation. On social media, different actors, 
often emboldened by a cloak of pseudonymity, are constantly reacting to each 
other. These interactions are usually markedly different from those in physical 
spaces, where our actions are influenced by verbal and non-verbal feedback from 
others.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>17)  Being aware of these pitfalls helps us to discern and unmask the logic 
that pollutes the social media environment and to search for a solution to such 
digital discontent. It is important to appreciate the digital world and 
recognize it as part of our life. It is, however, in the complementarity of 
digital and physical experiences that a human life and journey are built.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>18)  Along the &#8220;digital highways&#8221; many people are hurt by division and 
hatred. We cannot ignore it. We cannot be just silent passersby. In order to 
humanize digital environments, we must not forget those who are &#8220;left behind&#8221;. 
We can only see what is going on if we look from the perspective of the wounded 
man in the parable of the Good Samaritan. As in the parable, where we are 
informed about what the wounded man has seen, the perspective of the digitally 
marginalized and wounded helps us to understand better today&#39;s increasingly 
complex world. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Weaving relationships  </b>  </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>19)  In a time when we are increasingly divided, when each person retreats 
into his or her own filtered bubble, social media is becoming a path leading 
many towards indifference, polarization, and extremism. When individuals do not 
treat each other as human beings but as mere expressions of a certain point of 
view that they do not share, we witness another expression of the &#8220;throw-away 
culture&#8221; that proliferates the &#8220;globalization&#8221; &#8211; and normalization &#8211; &#8220;of 
indifference.&#8221; Retreating into the isolation of one&#8217;s own interests cannot be 
the way to restore hope. Rather, the way forward is the cultivation of a 
&#8220;culture of encounter&#8221;, which promotes friendship and peace among different 
people.<a name="_ftnref9" title href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>20)  Therefore, there is an increasingly urgent need to engage social media 
platforms in a way that goes beyond one&#8217;s silos, exiting the group of one&#8217;s 
&#8220;sames&#8221; in order to meet others.</p>
			<p>To welcome the &#8220;other&#8221;, someone who takes positions opposed to my own or who 
seems &#8220;different,&#8221; is certainly not an easy task. &#8220;Why should I care?&#8221; might 
well be our first reaction. We can even find this attitude in the Bible, 
starting with Cain&#8217;s refusal to be his brother&#8217;s keeper (cf. <i>Gen</i> 4:9)<sup>
</sup>and continuing with the scribe who asked Jesus, &#8220;Who is my neighbour?&#8221; (<i>Lk</i> 
10:29). The scribe wanted to set a limit regarding who <i>is</i> and who <i>is</i>
<i>not </i>my neighbour. It seems that we would like to find a justification for 
our own indifference; we are always trying to draw a line between &#8220;us&#8221; and 
&#8220;them&#8221;, between &#8220;someone I have to treat with respect&#8221; and &#8220;someone I can 
ignore.&#8221; In this way, almost imperceptibly, we grow incapable of feeling 
compassion for others, as if their sufferings were their own responsibility and 
none of our business<i>.</i><a name="_ftnref10" title href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>21)  The parable of the Good Samaritan, instead, challenges us to confront 
the digital &#8220;throw-away culture&#8221; and help each other to step out of our comfort 
zone by making a voluntary effort to reach out to the other. This is only 
possible if we empty ourselves, understanding that each one of us is part of 
wounded humanity, and remembering that someone has looked at us and had 
compassion on us.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>22)  
			It is only in this way that we can &#8211; and should &#8211; be the ones who make the first 
step in overcoming indifference, for we believe in a &#8220;God who is not 
indifferent&#8221;.<a name="_ftnref11" title href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> We can and should 
be the ones who stop asking, &#8220;How much do I really have to care for others?&#8221;, 
and begin instead to act as neighbours, rejecting the logic of exclusion and 
rebuilding a logic of community.<a name="_ftnref12" title href="#_ftn12">[12]</a><sup>
</sup>We can and should be the ones who move from the understanding of digital 
media as an individual experience to one that is founded upon mutual encounter, 
which fosters community-building. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>23)  Instead of acting as individuals, producing content or reacting to 
information, ideas and images shared by others, we need to ask: How can we 
co-create healthier online experiences where people can engage in conversations 
and overcome disagreements with a spirit of mutual listening?</p>
			<p>How can we empower communities to find ways to overcome divisions and promote 
dialogue and respect in social media platforms? </p>
			<p>How can we restore the online environment to the place that it can and should 
be: a place of sharing, collaborating, and belonging, based on mutual trust? </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>24) Everyone can participate in bringing about this change by 
			engaging with others, and by challenging themselves in their 
			encounters with others. As believers, we are called to be 
			communicators who move intentionally towards encounter. In this way, 
			we can seek encounters that are meaningful and lasting, rather than 
			superficial and ephemeral. Indeed, by orienting digital connections 
			towards encountering real persons, forming real relationships and 
			building real community, we are actually nourishing our relationship 
			with God. That said, our relationship with God must also be 
			nourished through prayer and the sacramental life of the Church, 
			which because of their essence can never be reduced simply to the 
			&#8220;digital&#8221; realm.</p>

<font color="#663300"><b>II.          From Awareness to True 
Encounter </b> <i><br>
Learning from the one who had compassion (cf. Lk 10:33). </i>
			</font> </p>
			<p><b>Intentional listeners</b></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>25)  The reflection on our engagement with social media began with an 
awareness of how these networks work and the opportunities and challenges we 
face in them. If online social networks bear an inherent temptation towards 
individualism and self-aggrandizement, as described in the preceding chapter, we 
are not condemned willy-nilly to fall into these attitudes. The disciple who has 
encountered the merciful gaze of Christ has experienced something else. He or 
she knows that communicating well begins with listening and an awareness that 
another person is before me. Listening and awareness aim to foster encounter and 
to overcome existing obstacles, including the obstacle of indifference. 
Listening in this manner is an essential step in engaging others; it is a first 
indispensable ingredient for communication and a condition for genuine dialogue.<a name="_ftnref13" title href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>26)  In the parable of the Good Samaritan, the man who was beaten and left 
to die was helped by the least expected person: in Jesus&#8217; time, the Jewish and 
Samaritan peoples were often at odds. If anything, hostility would have been the 
expected behavior. The Samaritan, however, did not see that beaten man as an 
&#8220;other,&#8221; but simply as someone who needed help. He felt compassion, putting 
himself in the other&#8217;s shoes; and gave of himself, his time, and his resources 
to listen to and accompany someone he encountered<a name="_ftnref14" title href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>. 
			</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>27)  The parable can inspire social media relationships because it 
illustrates the possibility of a profoundly meaningful encounter between two 
complete strangers. The Samaritan breaks down the &#8220;social divide&#8221;: he reaches 
beyond the boundaries of agreement and disagreement. While the priest and Levite 
pass by the wounded man, the Samaritan traveler sees him and has compassion (cf.
<i>Lk</i> 10:33). Compassion means feeling that the other person is a part of 
myself. The Samaritan listens to the man&#8217;s story; he draws near because he is 
moved from within. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>28)  The Gospel of Luke does not include any dialogue between the two men. 
We can imagine the Samaritan finding the wounded man and, perhaps, asking him, 
&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; But even without words, through his attitude of openness 
and hospitality, an encounter begins. That first gesture is an expression of 
care, and this is crucial. The ability to listen and be open to receiving the 
story of another without concern for the cultural prejudices of the time 
prevented the wounded man from being left for dead. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>29)  The interaction between the two men prompts us to make the first move 
in the digital world. We are invited to see the value and dignity of those with 
whom we have differences. We are also invited to look beyond our safety net, our 
silos, and our bubbles. Becoming a neighbour in the social media environment 
requires intentionality. And it all begins with the ability to listen well, to 
let the reality of the other touch us. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Robbing our attention </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>30)  Listening is a fundamental skill that allows us to enter into 
relationships with others and not just engage in the exchange of information. 
Our devices, however, are replete with information. We find ourselves embedded 
in an information network, connecting with others through shared postings of 
text, images, and sound. Social media platforms allow us to scroll endlessly as 
we explore this context. While video and sound have certainly increased the 
media-richness of digital communication, our mediated interactions with one 
another still remain limited. We often encounter information quickly and without 
the full and necessary context. We can react easily and rapidly to information 
on a screen without seeking the full story. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>31)  This abundance of information has many benefits: when we are part of 
the network, information is promptly and widely accessible and personalized to 
our interests. We can gain practical information, maintain social connections, 
explore resources, and deepen and expand our knowledge. The ease of access to 
information and communication also has the potential to create inclusive spaces 
that give voice to those in our communities who are marginalized by social or 
economic injustice. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>32)  At the same time, the endless availability of information has also 
created some challenges. We experience <i>information overload </i>as our 
cognitive ability to process suffers from the excessive information available to 
us. In a similar vein, we experience <i>social interaction overload</i> as we 
are subject to a high level of social solicitations. Different websites, 
applications, and platforms are programmed to prey on our human desire for 
acknowledgment, and they are constantly fighting for people&#8217;s attention. 
Attention itself has become the most valuable asset and commodity. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>33)  In this environment, our attention is not focused, as we attempt to 
navigate this overwhelming information and social interaction network. Instead 
of focusing on one issue at a time, our <i>continuous partial attention</i> 
rapidly passes from one topic to the other. In our &#8220;always on&#8221; condition, we 
face the temptation to post instantly since we are physiologically hooked on 
digital stimulation, always wanting more content in endless scrolling and 
frustrated by any lack of updates. One significant cognitive challenge of 
digital culture is the loss of our ability to think deeply and purposefully. We 
scan the surface and remain in the shallows, instead of deeply pondering 
realities.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>34)  We must be more mindful in this regard. Without silence and the space 
to think slowly, deeply, and purposefully, we risk losing not only cognitive 
capacities but also the depth of our interactions, both human and divine. The 
space for deliberate listening, attentiveness, and discernment of the truth is 
becoming rare.</p>
			<p>The process called <i>attention-interest-desire-action</i>, well known to 
advertisers, is similar to the process through which any temptation enters into 
the human heart and draws our attention away from the only word that is really 
meaningful and life-giving, the Word of God. In one way or another, we are still 
paying attention to the old serpent who shows us new fruits every day. They seem 
&#8220;good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom&#8221; (<i>Gen</i> 
3:6). Like seeds along the path, where the word is sown, we allow the evil one 
to come and take away the word that was sown in us (<i>c</i>f. <i>Mk</i> 
4:14-15). </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>35)  With this overload of stimuli and data that we receive, silence is a 
precious commodity, for it ensures space for focus and discernment.<a name="_ftnref15" title href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> The impetus to seek silence in digital culture elevates the importance of 
focusing and listening. In educational or work environments as well as in 
families and communities, there is a growing need to detach ourselves from 
digital devices. &#8220;Silence&#8221; in this case can be compared to a &#8220;digital detox&#8221;, 
which is not simply a withdrawal but rather a way to engage more deeply with God 
and with others. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>36)  Listening emerges from silence and is fundamental for caring for 
others. By listening we welcome someone, we offer hospitality and show that 
person respect. To listen is also an act of humility on our part, as we 
acknowledge truth, wisdom, and value beyond our own limited perspective. Without 
a listening disposition, we are not able to receive the gift of another. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>With the ear of the heart </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>37)  With the speed and immediacy of the digital culture, which tests our attentiveness and ability to focus,<b></b>listening becomes all the more important in our spiritual lives. A contemplative 
approach is countercultural, prophetic even, and may be formative not only for 
persons but for culture as a whole. </p>
			<p>A commitment to listening on social media is a fundamental starting point for 
moving towards a network that is not so much about bytes, avatars, and &#8220;likes&#8221; 
but of people.<a name="_ftnref16" title href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> In this way, we move from rapid reactions, misleading assumptions, and 
impulsive comments to creating opportunities for dialogue, raising questions to 
learn more, demonstrating care and compassion, and recognizing the dignity of 
those we encounter. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>38)  Digital culture has immeasurably increased our access to others. This 
also affords us the opportunity to listen to much more. Often when speaking of 
&#8220;listening&#8221; in social media, reference is made to data monitoring processes, 
engagement statistics, and actions aimed at a marketing analysis of the social 
behaviors present on the networks. This, of course, is not enough for social 
media to be an environment for listening and dialogue. Intentional listening in 
the digital context calls for listening with the &#8220;ear of the heart&#8221;. To listen 
with the &#8220;ear of the heart&#8221; goes beyond the physical ability to hear sounds. 
Instead, it impels us to be open to the other with the whole of our being: <i>an 
openness of the heart that makes closeness possible</i>.<a name="_ftnref17" title href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> It is a posture of attentiveness and hospitality that is fundamental for 
establishing communication. This wisdom applies not only to contemplative prayer 
but also to people seeking authentic relationships and genuine communities. The 
desire to be in relationship with others and with the Other &#8211; God &#8211; remains a 
fundamental human need, one that is also evident in the desire for connectedness 
in digital culture.<a name="_ftnref18" title href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>39)  An inner dialogue and a relationship with God, made possible by the 
divine gift of faith, are essential in allowing us to grow in our ability to 
listen well. The Word of God also has a fundamental role in this inner dialogue. 
Prayerful listening to the Word in Scripture through the practice of spiritual 
reading of biblical texts, such as in <i>lectio divina, </i>can be profoundly 
formative as it allows for a slow, deliberate and contemplative experience.<a name="_ftnref19" title href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>40)  The &#8220;Word of the Day&#8221; or &#8220;Gospel of the Day&#8221; are among the topics most 
googled by Christians, and it is safe to say that the digital environment has 
offered us many new and easier possibilities for a regular &#8220;meeting&#8221; with the 
divine Word. Our encounter with the Word of the living God, even online, shifts 
our approach from seeing information on the screen to encountering another 
person telling a story. If we keep in mind that we are connecting with other 
people behind the screen, the exercise of listening can extend hospitality to 
the stories of others, and begin forging relationships. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Discerning our Social Media Presence </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>41)  From the perspective of faith, what to communicate and how to 
communicate is not only a practical question but also a spiritual one. Being 
present on social media platforms prompts discernment. Communicating well in 
these contexts is an exercise in prudence, and calls for prayerful consideration 
of how to engage with others. Approaching this question through the lens of the 
scribe&#8217;s question, &#8220;Who is my neighbour?&#8221;, calls for discernment regarding God&#8217;s 
presence in and through the way we relate with one another on social media 
platforms. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>42)  On social media, neighbourliness is a complex concept. Social media 
&#8220;neighbours&#8221; are most clearly those with whom we maintain connections. At the 
same time, our neighbours are also often those we cannot see, either because 
platforms prevent us from seeing them or because they are simply not there. 
Digital environments are also shared by other participants such as &#8220;internet 
bots&#8221; and &#8220;deepfakes&#8221;, automated computer programs that operate online with 
assigned tasks, often simulating human action or collecting data. </p>
			<p>Additionally, social media platforms are controlled by an external &#8220;authority,&#8221; 
usually a for-profit organization that develops, manages, and promotes changes 
to how the platform is programmed to work. In a broader sense, these all &#8220;live 
in&#8221; or contribute to the online &#8220;neighbourhood.&#8221; </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>43)  Recognizing our digital neighbour is about recognizing that every 
person&#8217;s life concerns us, even when his or her presence (or absence) is 
mediated by digital means. &#8220;Today&#8217;s media do enable us to communicate and to 
share our knowledge and affections,&#8221; as Pope Francis says in <i>
			<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato si&#8217;</a></i>, 
&#8220;yet at times they also shield us from direct contact with the pain, the fears 
and the joys of others and the complexity of their personal experiences.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref20" title href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> To be neighbourly on social media means being present to the stories of 
others, especially those who are suffering. In other words, advocating for 
better digital environments does not mean taking the focus off the concrete 
problems experienced by many people &#8211; for example, hunger, poverty, forced 
migration, war, disease, and loneliness. It means, instead, advocating for an 
integral vision of human life that, today, includes the digital realm. In fact, 
social media can be one way to draw more attention to these realities and build 
solidarity among those near and far. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>44)  In viewing social media as a space not only for connections but 
ultimately for relationships, a proper &#8220;examination of conscience&#8221; regarding our 
presence on social media should include three vital relationships: with God, our 
neighbour, and the environment around us.<a name="_ftnref21" title href="#_ftn21">[21]</a> Our relationships with others and our environment should nourish our 
relationship with God, and our relationship with God, which is the most 
important, must be visible in our relationships with others and with our 
environment. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p> </p>

<font color="#663300"><b>III.     From Encounter to Community</b> <i><br>
&#8220;Look after him&#8221; (cf. Lk 10:35) &#8211; extending the healing process to others. 
			</i></font> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Face to face </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>45)  Communication begins with connection and moves towards relationships, 
community, and communion.<a name="_ftnref22" title href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> There is no communication without the truth of an encounter. To 
communicate is to establish relationships; it is to &#8220;be with&#8221;. To be community 
is to share with others fundamental truths about what one holds and what one is. 
Far beyond mere geographic-territorial or ethnic-cultural proximity, what 
constitutes a community is a common sharing of truth together with a sense of 
belonging, reciprocity, and solidarity, in the different spheres of social life. 
When considering these latter elements, it is important to remember that the 
construction of communal unity through communicative practices, which maintain 
social ties across time and space, will be always secondary with respect to the 
adherence to truth itself.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>46)  How to build a community through communicative practices even among 
those who are not physically near to each other is actually a very old question. 
We can identify a tension between mediated presence and a longing for in-person 
meeting already in the letters of the Apostles. The evangelist John, for 
example, concludes his second and third letter by saying &#8220;I have much to write 
to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and 
talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete<i>&#8221;</i> (<i>2</i> <i>
Jn</i> 12). The same is true for the apostle Paul, who, even in his absence and 
his &#8220;longing to see&#8221; the people in person (<i>1</i> <i>Thess</i> 2:17), was 
present through his letters in the life of every community he founded (cf. <i>1</i>
<i>Cor</i> 5:3). His writings also served to &#8220;interconnect&#8221; the different 
communities (cf. <i>Col</i> 4:15-16). Paul&#8217;s community-building capacity has 
been transmitted to our day through his many letters, where we learn that for 
him there was no dichotomy between physical presence and presence through his 
written word read by the community (cf. <i>2</i> <i>Cor</i> 10:9-11).  </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>47)  In the increasingly <i>onlife</i> reality of today&#8217;s world, it is 
necessary to overcome an &#8220;either-or&#8221; logic, which thinks of human relationships 
within a dichotomous logic (<i>digital</i> vs. <i>real-physical</i>-<i>in person</i>), 
and assume a &#8220;both-and&#8221; logic, based on the complementarity and wholeness of 
human and social life. Community relations on social media networks should 
strengthen local communities and vice versa. &#8220;The use of the <i>social web</i> 
is complementary to an encounter in the flesh that comes alive through the body, 
heart, eyes, gaze, and breath of the other. If the Net is used as an extension 
or expectation of such an encounter, then the network concept is not betrayed 
and remains a resource for communion.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref23" title href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> &#8220;The digital world can be an environment rich in humanity; a network not 
of wires but of people,&#8221;<a name="_ftnref24" title href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> if we remember that on the other side of the screen there are no &#8220;numbers&#8221; 
or mere &#8220;aggregates of individuals&#8221;, but people who have stories, dreams, 
expectations, sufferings. There is a name and a face.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>On the road to Jericho</b></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>48)  Digital media allows people to meet beyond the boundaries of space and 
cultures. Even though these digital encounters may not necessarily bring 
physical closeness, they can be nonetheless meaningful, impactful, and real. 
Beyond mere connections, they can be an avenue to engage sincerely with others, 
to engage in meaningful conversations, to express solidarity, and to relieve 
someone&#8217;s isolation and pain. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>49)  Social media can be seen as another &#8220;road to Jericho,&#8221; replete with 
opportunities for unplanned encounters as it was for Jesus: a blind beggar 
shouting loudly at the roadside (cf. <i>Lk</i> 18:35-43), a dishonest tax collector hiding in the branches of a sycamore tree (cf. <i>Lk</i> 19:1-9) and a wounded man left half dead by the robbers 
(cf. <i>Lk</i> 10:30). At the same time, the parable of the Good Samaritan 
reminds us that just because someone is &#8220;religious&#8221; (a priest or Levite) or 
claims to be a follower of Jesus, it is not a guarantee that they will offer 
help or seek healing and reconciliation. The blind man was rebuked by Jesus&#8217; 
disciples and told to be quiet; Zacchaeus&#8217; interaction with Jesus was 
accompanied by other people&#8217;s grumbling; the wounded man was simply ignored by 
the priest and the Levite as they passed by. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>50)  In the digital crossroads, as in face-to-face encounters, being 
&#8220;Christian&#8221; is not enough. It is possible to find many profiles or accounts on 
social media that proclaim religious content but do not engage in relational 
dynamics in a faithful way. Hostile interactions and violent, degrading words, 
especially in the context of sharing Christian content, cry out from the screen 
and are a contradiction to the Gospel itself.<a name="_ftnref25" title href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> 
			</p>
			<p>On the contrary, the Good Samaritan, who is attentive and open to encountering 
the wounded man, is moved with compassion to act and to care for him. He tends 
to the victim&#8217;s wounds and takes him to an inn to ensure his ongoing care. 
Likewise, our desires to make social media a more human and relational space 
must be translated into concrete attitudes and creative gestures. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>51)  Fostering a sense of community includes being attentive to shared 
values, experiences, hopes, sorrows, joys, humor and even jokes, that in and of 
themselves can become gathering points for people in digital spaces. As with 
listening, discernment, and encountering, forming community with others requires 
personal commitment. What is defined as &#8220;friendship&#8221; by social media platforms 
begins simply as a connection or familiarity. However, there, too, it is 
possible to emphasize a shared spirit of support and companionship. To become 
community requires a free and mutual sense of participation; to become a desired 
association that gathers members based on proximity. Freedom and mutual support 
do not emerge automatically. In order to form community, the work of healing and 
reconciliation is often the first step to be taken along the way. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>52)  Even on social media, &#8220;we have to decide whether to be Good Samaritans 
or indifferent bystanders. And if we extend our gaze to the history of our own 
lives and that of the entire world, all of us are, or have been, like each of 
the characters in the parable. All of us have in ourselves something of the 
wounded man, something of the robber, something of the passers-by, and something 
of the Good Samaritan<i>.</i>&#8221;<a name="_ftnref26" title href="#_ftn26">[26]</a></p>
			<p>All of us can be passersby on the digital highways - simply &#8220;connected&#8221;<sup>
</sup><a name="_ftnref27" title href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> -, or we can do something like the Samaritan and allow connections to grow 
into true encounters. The casual passerby becomes a neighbour when he cares for 
the wounded man by dressing his wounds. In caring for the man, he aims to heal 
not only the physical wounds but also the divisions and animosity that exist 
between their social groups. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>53)  What does it mean, then, to &#8220;heal&#8221; the wounds on social media? How can 
we &#8220;bind up&#8221; division? How can we build ecclesial environments capable of 
welcoming and integrating the &quot;geographical and existential peripheries&quot; of 
today&#8217;s cultures? Questions like these are essential for discerning our 
Christian presence on the digital highways. </p>
			<p>&#8220;Today we have a great opportunity to express our innate sense of fraternity, to 
be Good Samaritans who bear the pain of other people&#8217;s troubles rather than 
fomenting greater hatred and resentment. Like the chance traveler in the 
parable, we need only have a pure and simple desire to be a people, a community, 
constant and tireless in the effort to include, integrate and lift up the 
fallen.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref28" title href="#_ftn28">[28]</a>  </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>&#8220;Go and do likewise&#8221; </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>54)  Relationship begets relationship, community builds community. The 
grace of the relationship that is established between two people moves beyond 
their interaction. The human person is made for relationship and community. At 
the same time, loneliness and isolation plague our cultural reality, as we 
acutely experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those seeking company, 
especially the marginalized, often turn to digital spaces to find community, 
inclusion, and solidarity with others. While many have found solace in 
connecting with others in digital space, others find it inadequate. We may be 
failing to provide space for those seeking to engage in dialogue and find 
support without experiencing judgmental or defensive attitudes.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>55)  The movement from encounter to relationship and then community speaks 
to both the gifts and challenges of digital culture. Sometimes online 
communities form when people find common ground in gathering points against an 
external &#8220;other,&#8221; a common ideological enemy. This kind of polarization yields a 
&#8220;digital tribalism&#8221; wherein groups are pitted against others in an adversarial 
spirit. We cannot forget the presence of others, brothers and sisters, persons 
of dignity across these tribal lines. We &#8220;must not categorize others in order to 
decide who is my neighbour and who is not. It is up to me whether to be a 
neighbour or not &#8212; the decision is mine &#8212; it is up to me whether or not to be a 
neighbour to those whom I encounter, who need help, even if they are strangers 
or perhaps hostile<i>.</i>&#8221;<a name="_ftnref29" title href="#_ftn29">[29]</a> Unfortunately, broken relationships, conflicts, and divisions are not 
foreign to the Church. For example, when groups that present themselves as 
&#8220;Catholic&#8221; use their social media presence to foster division, they are not 
behaving like a Christian community should.<a name="_ftnref30" title href="#_ftn30">[30]</a> Instead of capitalizing on conflicts and adversarial clickbait, hostile 
attitudes should become opportunities for conversion, an opportunity to witness 
encounter, dialogue, and reconciliation around seemingly divisive matters<a name="_ftnref31" title href="#_ftn31">[31]</a>. 
			</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>56)  Engagement with social media must go beyond the exchange of personal 
opinions or the emulation of behaviors. Social action mobilized through social 
media has had a greater impact and is often more effective in transforming the 
world than a superficial debate regarding ideas. The debates are usually limited 
by the number of characters allowed and the speed with which people react to 
comments, not to mention emotional <i>ad hominem</i> arguments &#8211; attacks 
directed at the person speaking, regardless of the overall topic being 
discussed. </p>
			<p>Sharing ideas is necessary, but ideas alone do not work; they must become 
&#8220;flesh&#8221;. Actions must fertilize the ground day after day.<a name="_ftnref32" title href="#_ftn32">[32]</a></p>
			<p>Learning from the Samaritan, we are called to become attentive to this dynamic. 
He does not stop at feeling pity; he does not even stop at bandaging a 
stranger&#8217;s wounds. He goes further, taking the injured man to an inn and 
arranging for his continued care.<a name="_ftnref33" title href="#_ftn33">[33]</a> Through this arrangement, the relationship of care and the seeds of 
community established between the Samaritan and the wounded man are extended to 
the innkeeper and his household. </p>
			<p>Like the scholar of the law, we too, in our digital media presence, are invited 
to &#8220;go and do likewise&#8221; and so promote the common good. How can we help heal a 
toxic digital environment? How can we promote hospitality and opportunities for 
healing and reconciliation?  </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>57)  Hospitality builds on the openness we bring to encountering the other; 
through it, we welcome Christ in the guise of the stranger (cf. <i>Mt</i> 
25:40). For this, digital communities must share content and interests but also 
act together and become a witness for communion. There are already powerful 
expressions of communities of care in the digital context. For example, there 
are communities that gather to support others in times of illness, loss, and 
grief, as well as communities that crowdfund for someone in need and those who 
provide social and psychological support among members. All these efforts can be 
considered examples of &#8220;digital proximity&#8221;. People who are very different from 
each other can engage in an online &#8220;dialogue of social action&#8221;. They may or may 
not be inspired by faith. In any case, communities that are formed to act for 
the good of others are key to overcoming isolation in social media. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>58)  We can think even bigger: the social web is not cast in stone. We can 
change it. We can become drivers of change, imagining new models built on trust, 
transparency, equality, and inclusion. Together, we can urge media companies to 
reconsider their roles and let the internet become a truly public space. 
Well-structured public spaces are able to promote better social behavior. We 
need, therefore, to rebuild digital spaces so that they will become more human 
and healthier environments. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Sharing a Meal </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>59)  As a community of faith, the Church is on pilgrimage towards the 
Kingdom of Heaven. Since social media and, more broadly, digital reality is a 
crucial aspect of this journey, it is important to reflect on the dynamics of 
communion and community vis-a-vis the Church&#8217;s presence in the digital 
environment. </p>
			<p>During the most severe moments of lockdown during the pandemic, the broadcasting 
of liturgical celebrations via social media and other means of communication 
offered some comfort to those who could not participate in person. However, 
there is still much to reflect on in our faith communities about how to take 
advantage of the digital environment in a way that complements sacramental life. 
Theological and pastoral questions have been raised regarding various topics: 
for example, commercial exploitation of the retransmission of Holy Mass. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>60)  The ecclesial community is formed where two or three gather in the 
name of Jesus (cf. <i>Mt</i> 18:20) regardless of one&#8217;s origin, residence or 
geographical affiliation. While we can recognize that through the transmission 
of the Mass the Church has entered into people&#8217;s homes, it is necessary to 
reflect on what &quot;participation&quot; in the Eucharist means.<a name="_ftnref34" title href="#_ftn34">[34]</a> The emergence of the digital culture and the experience of the pandemic 
have revealed how much our pastoral initiatives have paid little attention to the &#8220;domestic Church&#8221;, the Church that gathers in 
homes and around the table. In this regard, we need to rediscover the link between the liturgy that is 
celebrated in our churches and the celebration of the Lord with the gestures, 
words and prayers in the family home. Put another way, we need to rebuild the 
bridge between our family tables and the altar, where we are spiritually 
nourished through our reception of the Holy Eucharist and confirmed in our 
communion as believers. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>61)  One cannot share a meal through a screen.<a name="_ftnref35" title href="#_ftn35">[35]</a> All our senses are engaged when we share a meal: taste and smell, glances 
that contemplate the faces of the diners, listening to the conversations at 
table. Sharing a meal at table is our first education in attention to others, a 
fostering of relationships among family members, neighbours, friends, and 
colleagues. Likewise, we participate with the whole person at the altar: mind, 
spirit, and body are involved. The liturgy is a sensory experience; we enter 
into the Eucharistic mystery through the doors of the senses that are awakened 
and fed in their need for beauty, meaning, harmony, vision, interaction and 
emotion. Above all, the Eucharist is not something that we can just &#8220;watch&#8221;; it 
is something that truly nourishes us. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>62)  Embodiment is important for Christians. The Word of God became 
incarnate in a body, he suffered and died with his body, and he rose again in 
the Resurrection in his body. After he returned to the Father, everything that 
he went through in his body flowed into the sacraments.<a name="_ftnref36" title href="#_ftn36">[36]</a> 
He entered into the heavenly sanctuary and left open a pilgrim way through which 
heaven is poured out upon us. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>63)  Being connected beyond the boundaries of space is not an achievement 
of &#8220;wonderful technological discoveries&#8221;. It is something we experience, even 
without knowing it, each time we &#8220;gather in the name of Jesus&#8221;, each time we 
participate in the universal communion of the body of Christ. There, we 
&#8220;connect&#8221; with the heavenly Jerusalem and meet the saints of all times and 
acknowledge each other as parts of the same Body of Christ.</p>
			<p>Therefore, as Pope Francis reminds us in his 
			<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/communications/documents/papa-francesco_20190124_messaggio-comunicazioni-sociali.html">2019 World Communications Day 
Message</a>, the <i>social web</i> complements &#8211; but does not substitute for &#8211; an 
encounter in the flesh that comes alive through the body, heart, eyes, gaze, and 
breath of the other. &#8220;If a family uses the Net to be more connected, to then 
meet at table and look into each other&#8217;s eyes, then it is a resource. If a 
Church community coordinates its activity through the network and then 
celebrates the Eucharist together, then it is a resource. (&#8230;) The Church herself 
is a network woven together by Eucharistic communion, where unity is based not 
on &#8220;likes&#8221;, but on the truth, on the &#8220;Amen&#8221;, by which each one clings to the 
Body of Christ, and welcomes others.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref37" title href="#_ftn37">[37]</a></p>

			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>   <font color="#663300"><b>IV.          A 
Distinctive Style </b> <i><br>
			Love &#8230; and you will live (cf. Lk 10:27-28). </i></font> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>The <i>what</i> and the <i>how</i>: The creativity of love </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>64)  Many Christian content-creators ask themselves: What is the most 
effective strategy to reach more users-persons-souls? What tool makes my content 
more attractive? What style works best? While these questions are helpful, we 
should always remember that communication is not simply a &#8220;strategy&#8221;. It is much 
more. A true communicator gives everything, gives all of himself or herself. We 
communicate with our soul and with our body, with our mind, our heart, our 
hands, with everything.<a name="_ftnref38" title href="#_ftn38">[38]</a></p>
			<p>By sharing the Bread of Life, we learn a &#8220;style of sharing&#8221; from the One who 
loved us and gave himself for us (cf. <i>Gal</i> 2:20). This style is reflected 
in three attitudes &#8211; &#8220;closeness, compassion and tenderness&#8221; &#8211; that Pope Francis 
recognizes as distinctive characteristics of God&#8217;s style.<a name="_ftnref39" title href="#_ftn39">[39]</a> Jesus himself, in his farewell dinner, assured us that the distinctive 
sign of his disciples would be to love one another as he has loved them. By 
this, everyone is able to recognize a Christian community (cf. <i>Jn</i> 
13:34-35). </p>
			<p>How might one reflect God&#8217;s &#8220;style&#8221; on social media? </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>65)  First of all, we should remember that whatever we share in our posts, 
comments, and likes, in spoken or written words, in film or animated images, 
should align with the style that we learn from Christ who transmitted his 
message not only in speech but in the whole manner of his life, revealing that 
communication, at its most profound level, is the giving of self in love.<a name="_ftnref40" title href="#_ftn40">[40]</a> Therefore, <i>how</i> we say something is just as important as <i>what</i> 
we say. All creativity lies in ensuring that the <i>how </i>corresponds to the
<i>what</i>. In other words, we can only communicate well if we &#8220;love well&#8221;.<a name="_ftnref41" title href="#_ftn41">[41]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>66)  To communicate truth, we must first make sure that we are conveying 
truthful information; not only in creating content, but also in sharing it. We 
must make sure that we are a trusted source. To communicate goodness, we need 
quality content, a message that is oriented to help, not to harm; to promote 
positive action, not to waste time in useless discussions. To communicate 
beauty, we need to make sure that we are communicating a message in its 
entirety, which needs the art of contemplation &#8211; an art that enables us to see a 
reality or an event linked to many other realities and events. </p>
			<p>In the context of &#8220;post-truth&#8221; and &#8220;fake news&#8221;, Jesus Christ, &#8220;the way and the 
truth and the life&#8221; (<i>Jn</i> 14:6) represents the principle for our communion 
with God and each other.<a name="_ftnref42" title href="#_ftn42">[42]</a> As 
Pope Francis reminded us in the 
			<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/communications/documents/papa-francesco_20190124_messaggio-comunicazioni-sociali.html">2019 World Communication Day Message</a>, &#8220;the duty 
to guard the truth springs from the need not to belie the mutual relationship of 
communion. Truth is revealed in communion. Lies, on the other hand, are a 
selfish refusal to recognize that we are members of one body; they are a refusal 
to give ourselves to others, thus losing the only way to find ourselves.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref43" title href="#_ftn43">[43]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>67)  For this reason, the second thing to remember is that a message is 
more easily persuasive when the one who communicates it belongs to a community. 
There is an urgent need to act not merely as individuals, but as communities. 
The fact that social media facilitates individual initiatives in content 
production could seem like a valuable opportunity but it can become problematic 
when individual activities are carried out capriciously and do not reflect the 
overall goal and outlook of the Church community. Setting aside our own agenda 
and the affirmation of our own abilities and skills, in order to discover that 
each one of us &#8211; with all our talents and weaknesses &#8211; is part of a group, is a 
gift that empowers us to collaborate as &#8220;members of one another.&#8221; We are called 
to give witness to a style of communication that fosters our belonging to one 
another, and that revives what Saint Paul calls the &#8220;joints&#8221; that enable the 
members of a body to act in synergy (<i>Col</i> 2:19).</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>68)  Our creativity can thus only be an outcome of communion: it is not so 
much the achievement of a great individual genius, but rather the fruit of a 
great friendship. In other words, it is the fruit of love. As Christian 
communicators we are called to bear witness to a style of communication that is 
not just based on the individual, but on a way of community-building and 
belonging. The best way to convey content is to put together the voices of those 
who love that content. Working together as a team, making space for diverse 
talents, backgrounds, capacities, and rhythms, co-creating beauty in a 
&#8220;symphonic creativity,&#8221; is actually the most beautiful witness that we are 
really children of God, redeemed from being concerned only with ourselves and 
open to an encounter with others.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Tell it with a story </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>69)  Good stories capture the attention and engage the imagination. They 
reveal and extend hospitality to the truth. Stories give us an interpretive 
framework to understand the world and to answer our deepest questions. Stories 
build community, for community is always built through communication. </p>
			<p>Storytelling has acquired a renewed importance in digital culture because of the 
unique power of stories to grab our attention and speak to us directly; they 
also provide a fuller context for communication than is possible in truncated 
posts or tweets. Digital culture is replete with information and its platforms 
are mostly chaotic environments. Stories offer a structure, a way to make sense 
of the digital experience. More &#8220;enfleshed&#8221; than a mere argument and more 
complex than the superficial and emotional reactions often encountered on 
digital platforms, they help to restore human relationships by offering people 
the opportunity to convey their stories or share those that have transformed 
them. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>70)  A good reason to tell a story is to respond to people who question our 
message or our mission. Creating a counter-narrative can be more effective in 
replying to a hateful comment than answering with an argument.<a name="_ftnref44" title href="#_ftn44">[44]</a> This way we shift the attention from defense to the active promotion of a 
positive message and the cultivation of solidarity, as Jesus did with the story 
of the Good Samaritan. Instead of arguing with the expert in the law about whom 
we should consider our neighbour and whom we can ignore or even hate, Jesus 
simply told a story. As a master storyteller, Jesus does not put the lawyer in 
the shoes of the Samaritan, but in the shoes of the wounded man. To find out who 
his neighbour is, he must first understand that he is in the shoes of the wounded 
man and that another has had compassion on him. Only when the lawyer has 
discovered this and has experienced the Samaritan&#8217;s care for him, can he draw 
conclusions about his own life and make the story his own. The lawyer himself is 
the man who has fallen into the hands of the robbers, and the Samaritan 
approaching him is Jesus. </p>
			<p>Each one of us, listening to this story, is the wounded man lying there. And for 
each one of us, the Samaritan is Jesus. For if we still ask, &#8220;Who is my 
neighbour?&#8221;, it is because we still have not experienced that we are loved and 
that our life is connected to every life. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>71)  From the beginning of the Church, telling the story of the profound 
experience that Jesus&#8217; followers had in his presence attracted others to 
Christian discipleship. The Acts of the Apostles are full of such examples. For 
instance, Peter was empowered by the Holy Spirit and preached the Resurrection 
of Christ to the pilgrims on Pentecost. This led to the conversion of three 
thousand people (cf. <i>Acts</i> 2:14-41). Here we get an idea of how much our 
storytelling can influence others. At the same time, recounting stories and 
experiences is just one element of evangelization. Systematic explanations of 
the faith done through the formulation of creeds and other doctrinal works are 
also important.   </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>Building community in a fragmented world </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>72)  People search for somebody that can give direction and hope; they are 
hungry for moral and spiritual leadership, but they do not often find it in 
traditional places. It is common now to turn to &#8220;influencers,&#8221; individuals who 
gain and maintain a large following, who acquire greater visibility and are able 
to inspire and motivate others with their ideas or experiences. Adopted from 
public opinion theory for the social media marketing approach, the success of a 
social media influencer is linked to his or her ability to stand out in the 
vastness of the network by attracting a large number of followers. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>73)  In itself, going &#8220;viral&#8221; is a neutral action; it does not 
automatically have a positive or a negative impact on the lives of others. In 
this regard, &#8220;Social networks can facilitate relationships and promote the good 
of society, but they can also lead to further polarization and division between 
individuals and groups. The digital world is a public square, a meeting-place 
where we can either encourage or demean one another, engage in a meaningful 
discussion or unfair attacks.&#8221;<a name="_ftnref45" title href="#_ftn45">[45]</a></p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>74)  <i>Micro- and macro-influencers </i></p>
			<p>We should all take our &#8220;influence&#8221; seriously. There are not only 
macro-influencers with a large audience, but also micro-influencers. Every 
Christian is a micro-influencer. Every Christian should be aware of his or her 
potential influence, no matter how many followers he or she has. At the same 
time, he or she needs to be aware that the value of the message conveyed by the 
Christian &#8220;influencer&#8221; does not depend on the qualities of the messenger. Every 
follower of Christ has the potential to establish a link, not to himself or 
herself, but to the Kingdom of God, even for the smallest circle of his or her 
relationships. &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved &#8211; you and your 
household&#8221;<sup> </sup>(<i>Acts</i> 16:31).</p>
			<p>However, we should recognize that our responsibility increases with the increase 
in the number of followers. The greater the number of followers, the greater our 
awareness should be that we are not acting in our own name. The responsibility 
to minister to one&#8217;s community, especially for those in public leadership roles, 
cannot become secondary to promoting one&#8217;s personal opinions from the public 
pulpits of digital media<a name="_ftnref46" title href="#_ftn46">[46]</a>. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>75)  <i>Be reflective, not reactive </i></p>
			<p>The Christian style should be reflective, not reactive, on social media. 
Therefore, we should all be careful not to fall into the digital traps hidden in 
content that is intentionally designed to sow conflict among users by causing 
outrage or emotional reactions. </p>
			<p>We must be mindful of posting and sharing content that can cause 
misunderstanding, exacerbate division, incite conflict, and deepen prejudices. 
Unfortunately, the tendency to get carried away in heated and sometimes 
disrespectful discussions is common with online exchanges. We can all fall into 
the temptation of looking for the &#8220;speck in the eye&#8221; of our brothers and sisters 
(<i>Mt</i> 7:3) by making public accusations on social media, stirring up 
divisions within the Church community or arguing about who among us is the 
greatest, as the first disciples did (<i>Lk</i> 9:46). The problem of polemical 
and superficial, and thus divisive, communication is particularly worrying when 
it comes from Church leadership: bishops, pastors, and prominent lay leaders. 
These not only cause division in the community but also give permission and 
legitimacy for others likewise to promote similar type of communication. </p>
			<p>In the face of this temptation, often the best course of action is not to react, 
or to react with silence so as not to dignify this false dynamic. It is safe to 
say that this kind of dynamic does not build up; on the contrary, it causes 
great harm. Thus, Christians are called to show another way. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>76)  <i>Be active, be synodal </i></p>
			<p>Social media can become an opportunity to share stories and experiences of 
beauty or suffering that are physically distant from us. In doing so, then, we 
can pray together and seek out the good together, rediscovering what unites us.<a name="_ftnref47" title href="#_ftn47">[47]</a> Being active means engaging in projects that affect people&#8217;s everyday 
lives: projects that promote human dignity and development, aim to reduce 
digital inequality, promote digital access to information and literacy, promote 
stewardship and crowdfunding initiatives in favor of those who are poor and 
marginalized and give voice to the voiceless in society. </p>
			<p>The challenges that we face are global and thus require a global collaborative 
effort. It is urgent then to learn to act together, as a community and not as 
individuals. Not so much as &#8220;individual influencers,&#8221; but as &#8220;weavers of 
communion&#8221;: pooling our talents and skills, sharing knowledge and contributions<a name="_ftnref48" title href="#_ftn48">[48]</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>For this reason, Jesus sent out the disciples &#8220;two by two&#8221; (cf. <i>Mk</i> 6:7), 
so that by walking together<a name="_ftnref49" title href="#_ftn49">[49]</a> we can reveal, also on social media, the synodal face of the Church. This 
is the profound meaning of the communion that unites all the baptized all over 
the world. As Christians, communion is part of our &#8220;DNA&#8221;. As such, the Holy 
Spirit enables us to open our hearts to others and embrace our membership in a 
universal fraternity. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b>The mark of witness </b> </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>77)  Our social media presence usually focuses on spreading information. 
Along these lines, presenting ideas, teachings, thoughts, spiritual reflections, 
and the like on social media needs to be faithful to the Christian tradition. 
But that is not enough. In addition to our ability to reach others with 
interesting religious content, we Christians should be known for our 
availability to listen, to discern before acting, to treat all people with 
respect, to respond with a question rather than a judgment, to remain silent 
rather than trigger a controversy and to be &#8220;quick to hear, slow to speak, slow 
to anger&#8221; (<i>Jas</i> 1:19). In other words, all that we do, in word and deed, 
should bear the mark of witness. We are not present in social media to &#8220;sell a 
product.&#8221; We are not advertising, but communicating life, the life that was 
given to us in Christ. Therefore, every Christian must be careful not to 
proselytize, but give witness. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>78)  What does it mean to be a witness? The Greek word for witness is 
&#8220;martyr,&#8221; and it is safe to say that some of the most powerful &#8220;Christian 
influencers&#8221; have been martyrs. The attractiveness of the martyrs is that they 
manifest their union with God through the sacrifice of their very lives.<a name="_ftnref50" title href="#_ftn50">[50]</a> &#8220;Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is 
in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own&#8221; (<i>1</i> <i>Cor</i> 
6:19). The bodies of martyrs are exemplary instruments for the revelation of the 
love of God. </p>
			<p>While martyrdom is the ultimate sign of Christian witness, every Christian is 
called to sacrifice himself or herself: Christian living is a vocation that 
consumes our very existence by offering ourselves, soul and body, to become a 
space for the communication of God&#8217;s love, a sign pointing toward the Son of 
God. </p>
			<p>It is in this sense that we better understand the words of the great John the 
Baptist, the first witness of Christ: &#8220;He must increase; I must decrease&#8221; (<i>Jn</i> 
3:30). Like the Forerunner, who urged his disciples to follow Christ, we too are 
not pursuing &#8220;followers&#8221; for ourselves, but for Christ. We can spread the Gospel 
only by forging a communion that unites us in Christ. We do this by following 
Jesus&#8217; example of interacting with others. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>79)  The attractiveness of faith reaches people where they are and how they 
are in the here and now. From being an unknown carpenter from Nazareth, Jesus 
quickly gained popularity all around the region of Galilee. Looking with 
compassion at the people, who were like sheep without a shepherd, Jesus 
proclaimed the Kingdom of God by healing the sick and teaching the crowds. To 
assure the maximum &#8220;reach&#8221;, he would often speak to the multitudes from a 
mountain or from a boat. To promote the &#8220;engagement&#8221; of some his number, he 
chose twelve and to them he explained everything. But then, unexpectedly, at the 
height of his &#8220;success&#8221;, he would retreat into solitude with the Father. And he 
would ask his disciples to do the same: when they were recounting the success of 
their missions, he invited them to come away to rest and pray. And when they 
were discussing who among them was the greatest, he announced to them his future 
suffering on the cross. His objective &#8211; they would understand it only later &#8211; 
was not to increase his audience, but to reveal the love of the Father so that 
people, all people, may have life and have it to the full (cf. <i>Jn</i> 10:10).</p>
			<p>Following in the footsteps of Jesus, we should make it a priority to allot 
enough space for personal conversation with the Father and to remain in tune 
with the Holy Spirit, who will always remind us that everything has been 
reversed on the Cross. There were no &#8220;likes&#8221; at all and almost no &#8220;followers&#8221; at 
the moment of the biggest manifestation of the glory of God! Every human 
measurement of &#8220;success&#8221; is relativized by the logic of the Gospel. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>80)  This is our witness: to vouch, with our words and our lives, for what 
someone else has done.<a name="_ftnref51" title href="#_ftn51">[51]</a> In this sense, and only in this sense, can we be witnesses &#8211; missionaries 
even &#8211; of Christ and his Spirit. This includes our engagement with social media. 
Faith means above all bearing witness to the joy that the Lord gives to us. And 
this joy always shines brightly against the backdrop of a grateful memory. 
Telling others about the reason for our hope and doing it with gentleness and 
respect (<i>1 Pt</i> 3:15) is a sign of gratitude. It is the response of one 
who, through gratitude, is made docile to the Spirit and is therefore free. This 
was true for Mary, who without wanting or trying, became <i>the most influential 
woman in history</i>.<a name="_ftnref52" title href="#_ftn52">[52]</a> It is the response of one who by the grace of humility does not put 
himself or herself in the foreground and thus facilitates the encounter with 
Christ who said: &#8220;Learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart&#8221; (<i>Mt</i> 
11:29).</p>
			<p>Following the logic of the Gospel, all we have to do is to provoke a question to 
awaken the search. The rest is the hidden work of God.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p align="center">***</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>81)  As we have seen, we travel the digital highways alongside friends and 
complete strangers, striving to avoid many pitfalls along the way, and we find 
ourselves becoming aware of the wounded on the side of the road. At times, these 
wounded may be other people. Sometimes we are the wounded ones. When this 
happens, we pause, and through the life we have received in the sacraments, 
which is at work in us, this awareness becomes encounter: from characters or 
images on a screen, the wounded man takes on the contours of a neighbour, a 
brother or sister, and indeed, the Lord, who said, &#8220;Whatever you do to one of 
the least of these&#8230; you did it to me&#8221; (<i>Mt</i> 25:40). And if at times we are 
also the ones who are wounded, the Samaritan bending over us with compassion 
also bears the face of the Lord, who became our neighbour, bending over 
suffering humanity to tend to our wounds.</p>
			<p>In either case, what might have begun as a chance meeting or distracted presence 
on social media platforms becomes people present to one another in an encounter

and Saint Paul longed for in their letters: the face-to-face encounter of every 
wounded person with the Lord&#8217;s Body, the Church, so that in a personal, 
heart-to-heart encounter, their wounds and ours may be healed and &#8220;our joy may 
be complete&#8221; (<i>2</i> <i>Jn </i>12).</p>

by pouring oil and wine over them, be our inspiration. Let our communication be 
a balm that relieves pain and a fine wine that gladdens hearts. May the light we 
bring to others not be the result of cosmetics or special effects, but rather of 
our being loving and merciful &#8220;neighbours&#8221; to those wounded and left on the side

Father has been active on Twitter and since 2016, on Instagram. Parallel to 
this, the digitally mediated presence of the Pope has become one of the methods 
of his pastoral engagement, beginning with video messages in the mid-2000s, 
followed by live video conferencing such as the 2017 meeting with the astronauts 
of the International Space Station. The Pope&#8217;s 2017 video message to the Super 
Bowl in the United States, and his TED Talks in 2017 and 2020 are just two 
examples of the Pope&#8217;s digitally mediated pastoral presence. </p>

					<i>Statio Orbis</i></a> drew about 6 million viewers on the Vatican News 
YouTube Channel and 10 million on Facebook. These numbers do not include later 
views of the recording of the event or views through other media channels. The

the account. </p>
					<p><a name="_ftn7" title href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> Among the many Gospel images that could have been chosen as inspiration for this

parable about communication.&#8221; Cf. <i>

funds these new producers of public opinion? How can we ensure that those who 
design the algorithms are guided by ethical principles and help spread globally 
a new awareness and critical thinking to minimize harm in the new information platforms? New media literacy should cover competencies that not only enable people 
critically and effectively to engage with information but also to discern the

					<p><a name="_ftn46" title href="#_ftnref46">[46]</a> This concerns also the formation of priests. As we read in the 
					<i>Ratio 
Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</i>, &#8220;Pastors of the future cannot be aloof, either during their formation or their 
future ministry, from the public square of social media&#8221; (No. 97). They might be also aware of the inevitable risks that come with frequenting the 
digital world, including various forms of addiction (cf. No. 99). On this aspect see also the

					<p><a name="_ftn48" title href="#_ftnref48">[48]</a> It might be useful, therefore, that individual initiatives on social media, 
especially those that originate with religious and clergy, find a way to enhance 
communion in the Church. As a Christian community, it might be helpful as well 
to reach out to the &#8220;influencers&#8221; that are at the margins of our ecclesial 
environments. </p>

walking together, moving forward together. </p>
					<p><a name="_ftn50" title href="#_ftnref50">[50]</a> This was described already by the ancient Church Fathers. Tertullian, for example, spoke about martyrdom as attractiveness. In his
					<i>Apology</i>, he explains that the persecutions are not only unjust, but also 
pointless: &#8220;None of your cruelty, however exquisite, will avail you; rather, it 
makes our religion more attractive. The more we are mown down by you, the more 
we grow in number; <i>the blood of Christians is the seed </i>of a new life. 
(...) That very obstinacy you rail against is a lesson. For who that 
contemplates it, is not excited to inquire what is at the bottom of it? Who, 
after inquiry, does not embrace our doctrines?&#8221; Tertullian, <i>Apology</i>, n. 
50 (<i>translation adapted</i>).</p>
