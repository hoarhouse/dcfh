                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>Military powers worldwide are racing to develop lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) that can select and engage targets without meaningful human control. These systems fundamentally challenge our understanding of accountability, proportionality, and discrimination in warfare. Current development trajectories suggest that fully autonomous weapons could be deployed within the next five years, creating a new arms race that threatens global stability.</p>
                            <p>The speed of AI decision-making exceeds human cognitive capabilities, potentially leading to escalation spirals that humans cannot interrupt. Without immediate intervention, we risk creating weapons that operate beyond human moral judgment, undermining centuries of just war tradition and international humanitarian law.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>Nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) systems increasingly rely on digital infrastructure vulnerable to cyber attacks. Recent assessments reveal that even minor intrusions could trigger false warnings or compromise decision-making processes during crises. The integration of AI into early warning systems introduces new risks of misinterpretation and automated escalation.</p>
                            <p>The compressed decision timelines in nuclear scenarios, combined with AI-driven analysis, create unprecedented risks of accidental war. A single algorithmic error or successful cyber intrusion could initiate an irreversible chain of events, potentially leading to nuclear exchange based on false information.</p>

                            <p>Artificial intelligence systems operate at speeds that compress decision-making from hours to milliseconds. In conflict scenarios, AI-enabled systems could escalate confrontations faster than human leaders can assess situations or negotiate solutions. The interaction between multiple AI systems from different nations creates unpredictable dynamics that no single actor can control.</p>
                            <p>Machine learning algorithms trained on historical conflict data may perpetuate or amplify past patterns of violence, while lacking the human capacity for empathy, creativity in problem-solving, or recognition of unprecedented situations requiring restraint.</p>

                            <p>Current international law and ethical frameworks were developed for human-controlled weapons and cannot adequately address the challenges of autonomous systems. Technical communities often lack grounding in moral philosophy, while ethicists may not fully grasp the technical realities of AI systems. This gap threatens to leave humanity without adequate guardrails as these technologies proliferate.</p>
                            <p>Religious traditions offer millennia of wisdom about violence, peace, and human dignity, but this wisdom must be translated into actionable principles for the digital age. The Catholic Church's global reach and moral authority position it uniquely to bridge these divides.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
                <div class="mb-5">
                    <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Catholic Social Teaching Meets Technology</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        The summit grounds technological discussions in two millennia of Catholic moral tradition. We draw upon principles of human dignity, 
                        the common good, subsidiarity, and solidarity to evaluate emerging technologies. This isn't about imposing religious doctrine on 
                        secular systems, but rather offering time-tested wisdom about human nature and social organization that transcends technological change.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Catholic social teaching provides a framework for evaluating not just what we can build, but what we should build. The principle 
                        of human dignity demands that lethal decisions remain under meaningful human control. The common good requires us to consider 
                        global impacts, not just national advantages. Subsidiarity guides us toward governance structures that respect both local contexts 
                        and universal principles.

                        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                            The summit serves as a catalyst for unprecedented cooperation between religious institutions, civil society organizations, 
                            academic institutions, and technology companies. We're building bridges between communities that rarely interact directly: 
                            Vatican officials and Silicon Valley engineers, military ethicists and peace activists, Global South voices and Northern 
                            technology centers.

                        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                            Our coalition-building approach recognizes that no single actor can address these challenges alone. By creating spaces for 
                            dialogue across traditional divides, we're fostering the relationships and mutual understanding necessary for coordinated 
                            global action. The summit isn't just an event but the beginning of an ongoing collaborative process.

                            Digital Christian Fellowship Hungary is a pioneering organization at the intersection of faith and technology. 
                            Founded to explore how digital innovation can serve the common good while respecting human dignity, DCF Hungary 
                            has become a leading voice in Catholic technology ethics. Our initiatives include educational programs for church 
                            leaders on digital transformation, hackathons for social good, and regular dialogues between technologists and theologians.

                            Through partnerships with Vatican institutions, European technology centers, and global peace organizations, 
                            DCF Hungary has developed unique expertise in translating between technical and theological languages. Our work 
                            has influenced church positions on artificial intelligence, supported digital evangelization efforts, and fostered 
                            a new generation of Catholic technologists committed to building technology that serves humanity.
