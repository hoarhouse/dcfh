                        <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in weapons systems and the increasing vulnerability of nuclear command systems to cyber attacks represent existential threats to humanity. As Catholic leaders and technologists, we have a moral imperative to address these challenges before they become irreversible. This summit brings together the wisdom of faith tradition with cutting-edge technological expertise to forge a path toward digital peace.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Unlike purely technical conferences or traditional religious gatherings, the Cyberpeace Summit integrates Catholic social teaching with practical policy solutions. We bridge the gap between moral philosophy and technical implementation, creating actionable frameworks that respect human dignity while addressing real-world security concerns. Our multi-stakeholder approach ensures that solutions are both ethically grounded and technically feasible.</p>

                        <p>The international community is at a crossroads. Key decisions about AI governance and cyber weapons are being made now that will shape the next decades. The UN's discussions on autonomous weapons systems are reaching critical junctures, and national AI strategies are being finalized. February 2026 represents a unique opportunity to influence these processes before positions become entrenched.</p>
                        
                        <p>Major powers are rapidly developing and deploying AI-enabled weapons systems. Without immediate intervention from moral authorities and civil society, we risk normalizing technologies that fundamentally challenge human dignity and the principles of just war theory.</p>

                        <p>The pace of AI development is exponential, not linear. Systems being designed today will be deployed at scale by 2027. The decisions we make in 2026 about ethical boundaries and regulatory frameworks will determine whether these technologies serve peace or accelerate conflict.</p>
                        
                        <p>Recent incidents of AI hallucinations in military contexts and near-misses in nuclear command systems underscore the urgency. We cannot wait for a catastrophe to act. The Catholic Church's moral authority and global reach position it uniquely to convene stakeholders and drive consensus before it's too late.</p>
