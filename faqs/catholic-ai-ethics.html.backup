                <h3 class="faq-question">What is Catholic AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic AI ethics is the application of Catholic moral teaching—particularly principles of human dignity, the common good, and social justice—to the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. It asks not just "can we build this?" but "should we build this?" and "who does it serve?"
                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Technology must not be allowed to dominate human beings, but must remain always at the service of the human person and the common good."

                <h3 class="faq-question">How is Catholic AI ethics different from secular AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">While secular AI ethics often focuses on harm reduction, fairness, and transparency, Catholic ethics grounds these concerns in the inherent, God-given dignity of every human person. This means human worth is non-negotiable—it doesn't depend on productivity, intelligence, or economic value. Catholic teaching also emphasizes solidarity (we're responsible for each other) and the common good (technology should serve all of humanity, not just the powerful).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Does the Vatican oppose AI technology?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. The Vatican does not oppose AI technology itself. Pope Francis has stated that AI "can help to overcome ignorance and facilitate the exchange of information." The Church supports technological advancement but insists it must serve human dignity. The Vatican's concern is not with AI as a tool, but with how it's deployed—particularly when automation prioritizes profit over people.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does "human dignity" mean in the context of AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">In Catholic teaching, human dignity is the inherent worth of every person, regardless of their productivity, capabilities, or social status. For AI ethics, this means: systems cannot treat people as mere optimization variables; disabled, elderly, or economically "unproductive" people deserve equal consideration; human moral reasoning cannot be outsourced to algorithms; and people have the right to understand and contest decisions made about them. AI must respect each person as a subject with agency and conscience, not an object to be processed.</p>
                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real-World Example: Clearview AI Facial Recognition</h3>
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Clearview AI scraped billions of photos from social media without consent to build a massive facial recognition database sold to law enforcement and private companies.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Ethical Violations:</strong> This violated privacy rights, dignity (reducing persons to biometric data points), and consent. People's faces were harvested and commodified without their knowledge or permission.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Catholic Response:</strong> This demonstrates multiple violations of Catholic AI ethics—lack of informed consent, treating persons as mere data, enabling surveillance that threatens freedom, and prioritizing profit over dignity. Facial recognition requires strict ethical guardrails and must never be deployed without robust protections for privacy and human rights.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can AI systems make moral decisions?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. Catholic teaching holds that moral decisions require conscience, empathy, the ability to recognize context and nuance, and the capacity to take moral responsibility for outcomes. AI systems, no matter how sophisticated, lack these qualities. They can calculate, optimize, and predict, but they cannot experience the weight of moral choice or be held truly accountable. This is why the Vatican insists that humans must retain final authority over consequential decisions, especially those involving life, death, justice, or human welfare.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the "common good" in AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The common good is a core principle of Catholic social teaching, referring to conditions that allow all people and communities to flourish. For AI, this means technology should serve everyone's wellbeing, not just maximize profit or efficiency for a few. It requires: ensuring AI benefits reach marginalized communities; preventing wealth and power concentration among tech companies; protecting workers displaced by automation; and designing systems that strengthen rather than undermine social bonds and democratic participation.</p>
                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Artificial intelligence must be developed with constant attention to its effects on the most vulnerable and marginalized members of society."
                    <cite>— Antiqua et Nova (2025)</cite>
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does "wisdom of the heart" mean?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Francis frequently uses this phrase to distinguish between information processing and genuine understanding. "Wisdom of the heart" means knowledge guided by love, empathy, and moral purpose—capacities AI cannot replicate. While AI excels at optimization and calculation, wisdom involves knowing what matters, recognizing what should not be sacrificed for efficiency, and understanding that human relationships and dignity are more important than data or profit. It's the difference between knowing how to build something and knowing why people need it.</p>
                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real-World Example: Algorithmic Hiring Systems</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Efficiency Approach:</strong> Companies use AI to screen thousands of resumes in minutes, optimizing for keywords and patterns from past "successful" hires.</p>
                    <p><strong>What Gets Lost:</strong> The algorithms miss unconventional career paths, penalize employment gaps (which disproportionately affect women and caregivers), and perpetuate existing workplace homogeneity by replicating past patterns.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Wisdom Deficit:</strong> This demonstrates the difference between algorithmic efficiency and human wisdom. Effective hiring requires recognizing potential, understanding context, valuing diverse perspectives, and seeing the whole person—not just pattern-matching resumes. Catholic teaching insists that efficiency must never override human judgment about human beings.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Does Catholic teaching say AI is inherently evil?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. Catholic teaching doesn't view technology as inherently good or evil—moral character comes from how it's designed, deployed, and used. AI is a tool, and like any tool, it inherits the intentions and values of its creators. The Church emphasizes that AI can serve human flourishing if developed with wisdom and guided by moral principles that prioritize human dignity. The danger isn't AI itself, but allowing technological capability to outpace ethical reflection, or letting profit motives override concern for human welfare.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the Rome Call for AI Ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Rome Call for AI Ethics is a landmark Vatican initiative launched in February 2020 that established six core principles for ethical AI development: transparency, inclusion, accountability, impartiality, reliability, and security/privacy. What makes it unique is that major technology companies including Microsoft, IBM, and Cisco signed this declaration alongside religious leaders, governments, and international organizations, committing to develop AI that respects human dignity and serves the common good. The Rome Call represents the Vatican's attempt to provide moral guardrails for AI development before harmful practices become entrenched.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">When did the Vatican start working on AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican's formal AI ethics work began around 2018-2019 when the Pontifical Academy for Life convened a working group of priests, engineers, ethicists, and data scientists to develop a comprehensive moral framework for artificial intelligence. This culminated in the Rome Call for AI Ethics in February 2020 and Pope Francis addressing AI at the G7 summit in June 2024. However, the intellectual foundation goes back decades—the Vatican has been addressing technology ethics systematically since at least 1991, when Pope John Paul II began connecting disarmament ethics to emerging autonomous technologies.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are the six principles of the Rome Call for AI Ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The six principles are: (1) Transparency—AI systems must be explainable and understandable to users; (2) Inclusion—systems must not create or reinforce discrimination against any group; (3) Accountability—humans must take responsibility for AI decisions and their consequences; (4) Impartiality—AI must not create or amplify biases; (5) Reliability—AI must work consistently and safely; and (6) Security and Privacy—systems must protect users' data and dignity. These principles are meant to be universal, applying across cultures and religious traditions.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What papal documents address AI and technology?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">While no single papal encyclical is dedicated entirely to AI, several major documents address technology ethics: Pope Francis's encyclical "Laudato Si'" (2015) discusses technology's relationship to creation and the environment; "Fratelli Tutti" (2020) addresses technology's impact on human solidarity and community; his 2024 message for World Peace Day was titled "Artificial Intelligence and Peace"; and his June 2024 address at the G7 summit focused on AI ethics. Additionally, John Paul II's "Centesimus Annus" (1991) established principles about technology serving human dignity that inform current AI teaching.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How has the Vatican's AI position evolved?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican's AI position has evolved from general warnings about technology in the 1990s-2000s to specific, sophisticated frameworks for AI governance. Early teaching focused on nuclear weapons and biotechnology. By the 2010s, attention shifted to digital technology, surveillance, and automation. The Rome Call in 2020 marked a turning point—moving from warnings to constructive engagement with the tech industry. By 2024, Pope Francis was addressing world leaders at the G7 on AI, demonstrating the Vatican's recognition that AI ethics is now a central moral question of our time, not a niche concern.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What role does the Pontifical Academy for Life play?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Pontifical Academy for Life, established by Pope John Paul II in 1994 to address bioethical questions, has become the Vatican's primary institution for AI ethics work. Under the leadership of Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, the Academy convened the working group that produced the Rome Call for AI Ethics and continues to organize conferences, publish research, and engage with technology companies, governments, and international organizations. The Academy serves as the Vatican's bridge between Catholic moral theology and cutting-edge technology development, bringing together theologians, ethicists, scientists, and industry leaders.</p>

            <h2>AI & Work</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does Catholic teaching say about job automation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic Social Teaching views work as essential to human dignity, not just a source of income. For deeper understanding of how this connects to fairness principles, see our <a href="ai-bias-fairness.html">guide on AI bias and fairness</a>. According to Pope John Paul II's 1981 encyclical Laborem Exercens, work is "participation in creation itself" that allows humans to find purpose and contribute to the common good. When automation eliminates jobs without providing alternatives or support for displaced workers, it violates this fundamental dignity. The Vatican teaches that economic decisions are moral decisions, and companies must measure the moral cost of automation alongside economic gains. Work gives people not just income but identity, purpose, and community belonging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the Vatican's position on AI replacing human workers?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican teaches that human dignity cannot be outsourced. While AI can optimize processes and improve efficiency, the Church insists that any decision to automate must consider its full moral impact on workers and communities. Pope Francis warns against the "tyranny of the market" that accepts new technology "without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings." The Vatican argues that prosperity which abandons workers is "theft disguised as innovation," and that society owes displaced workers solidarity—including strong safety nets, retraining programs, and fair wealth distribution—not just empty promises that market forces will create new jobs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does Catholic ethics differ from typical business approaches to automation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Most businesses view automation through a purely economic lens: maximizing output while minimizing labor costs. Catholic ethics reverses this framework. As Pope John Paul II stated, "Work is for man, not man for work." This means technology should serve human flourishing, not replace human participation. Where businesses see workers as costs to eliminate, Catholic teaching sees workers as subjects with inherent dignity whose welfare is a moral obligation. The Vatican calls for corporations to: count the full social cost of automation including community impact; use AI to augment rather than replace human workers where possible; and share automation profits with workers through profit-sharing or wage increases.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What practical policies does the Vatican suggest for managing AI and automation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican's teaching suggests several policy approaches. For governments: slow automation in sectors where job loss would devastate communities; tax productivity gains from automation to fund education, wage subsidies, or universal basic income; enforce strong labor rights in the era of gig work and algorithmic management; and invest in education systems that prepare people for a changing economy. For corporations: assess full social costs before deploying automation; explore using AI to augment human capabilities rather than eliminate jobs entirely; provide substantial support for displaced workers; and share profits generated by automation. The goal is ensuring technological progress serves the common good, not just corporate efficiency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Does the Vatican support universal basic income?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">While the Vatican has not officially endorsed universal basic income as specific policy, Pope Francis's teaching on automation and work opens the door to such discussions. His emphasis on "intergenerational solidarity" and the need for "strong safety nets" when automation displaces workers suggests support for bold economic interventions. The Church's principle that "dignity is not a byproduct of productivity" aligns with UBI's premise that human worth exists independent of labor market participation. Catholic teaching invites serious debate about UBI alongside other options like shorter workweeks and revaluation of care work—all grounded in protecting human dignity during technological transition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How should companies approach AI-driven layoffs according to Catholic ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic ethics demands that companies view AI-driven layoffs as moral decisions, not merely economic ones. Before automating jobs, corporations should: conduct thorough assessment of full social cost including community impact; explore whether AI can augment workers rather than replace them entirely; provide substantial support for displaced workers including generous severance, comprehensive retraining, and job placement assistance; and consider sharing automation profits through profit-sharing programs or wage increases for remaining workers. Pope Francis warns that when corporations replace thousands of employees with software while enriching shareholders, they make "a moral choice disguised as efficiency." The Church teaches that companies have obligations to workers and communities that extend beyond maximizing shareholder returns.</p>

        <!-- AI & WARFARE -->
        <div class="faq-section" id="weapons">
            <h2>AI & Warfare</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the Vatican's position on autonomous weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican holds that some decisions are too fundamentally human to delegate to machines, particularly life-and-death choices in warfare.
                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "The decision to use lethal force must never be delegated to a machine lacking human qualities like compassion and the capacity for ethical judgment."
                    <cite>— Pope Francis, Message for World Day of Peace (2024)</cite>
                </div> The Church argues that autonomous weapons systems that can select and engage targets without meaningful human control cross a moral red line. This position is rooted in Catholic teaching on human dignity and moral responsibility—machines cannot bear the weight of conscience that killing requires. The Vatican has called for international treaties to prevent fully autonomous weapons from being deployed, arguing that the decision to take a life must always involve human judgment, the capacity for mercy, and moral accountability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does the Vatican connect nuclear weapons to AI weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican draws a direct line from nuclear deterrence ethics to AI warfare ethics. Both technologies involve delegating catastrophic decisions to systems that can act faster than human moral reasoning. Pope Francis's 2019 visit to Nagasaki and Hiroshima explicitly connected the atomic bomb's legacy to emerging AI threats, arguing that both represent the danger of letting technological capability outpace ethical restraint. The Church views autonomous weapons as a new form of the same fundamental problem: the temptation to remove human judgment from decisions that demand it. Just as nuclear weapons threatened civilization in the 20th century, autonomous AI weapons pose a 21st-century existential threat.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does "meaningful human control" mean in the context of AI weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Meaningful human control means that humans must remain in the decision-making loop for any use of lethal force. It's not enough for a human to activate a weapon system and let algorithms determine who dies. The Vatican insists that human judgment—including the ability to refuse orders, assess proportionality, recognize surrender, and exercise mercy—must be present at the moment force is applied. This opposes "fire and forget" systems where AI makes targeting decisions autonomously. The Church argues that moral responsibility cannot be transferred to code. A human operator must have sufficient information, time, and authority to make a genuine moral choice about using lethal force.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why does the Vatican say AI weapons are different from other military technology?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican distinguishes AI weapons because they fundamentally alter the relationship between human decision-making and lethal force. Previous military technologies—from swords to drones—have been tools controlled by human operators who bear moral responsibility for their use. Autonomous AI systems make kill decisions independently based on algorithms and training data, removing the human element that Catholic ethics considers essential: the capacity for moral judgment, contextual understanding, restraint, and accountability. A machine cannot experience the weight of taking a life, cannot show mercy, cannot be held morally responsible for war crimes, and cannot make the prudential judgments that Just War Theory requires.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Has the Vatican called for a ban on all military AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. The Vatican distinguishes between AI that assists human decision-making and AI that replaces it. The Church does not oppose AI systems that enhance intelligence gathering, improve logistics, optimize supply chains, or help commanders understand battlefield conditions—as long as humans retain final authority over lethal force. What the Vatican opposes specifically are fully autonomous weapons systems that can identify, select, and engage targets without meaningful human control. The line is drawn at delegating the decision to kill. Defensive AI systems, decision support tools, and human-supervised applications are not categorically opposed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the connection between Just War Theory and AI weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Just War Theory, developed over centuries of Catholic moral theology, requires that warfare meet strict ethical criteria including: just cause, right intention, proportionality, discrimination between combatants and civilians, reasonable chance of success, and last resort. The Vatican argues that autonomous weapons cannot satisfy these requirements because they lack moral reasoning and contextual judgment. An AI cannot weigh the value of a military objective against civilian suffering, cannot recognize when an enemy is attempting to surrender, cannot make nuanced judgments about proportionality in specific circumstances, and cannot be held accountable for violations of the laws of war. These moral capabilities are exclusively human.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why does the Vatican participate in U.N. discussions on AI weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican participates as a permanent observer at the United Nations and as a sovereign state with diplomatic recognition, giving it a voice in international law and disarmament discussions. The Holy See views the regulation of AI weapons as a moral imperative, not just a military or political issue. By bringing Catholic ethical teaching to U.N. debates on lethal autonomous weapons systems, the Vatican aims to ensure that human dignity and moral responsibility remain central to how the international community governs emerging weapons technologies. The Church believes it has both the moral authority built over two millennia and the historical perspective to warn against technologies that threaten fundamental human values and could destabilize global security.</p>

        <!-- ROME CALL & POLICY -->
        <div class="faq-section" id="rome-call">
            <h2>Rome Call & Policy</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why did tech companies agree to sign the Rome Call?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Tech companies signed the Rome Call in February 2020 for several strategic reasons. It provided moral credibility at a time when AI ethics was becoming a critical public concern and regulatory threat. The Vatican offered unique convening power—it wasn't beholden to any government or corporation, making it a neutral forum where competitors could agree on principles. Signing demonstrated ethical commitment without immediate legal obligations or enforcement mechanisms. For companies facing increasing scrutiny over AI bias, privacy violations, and social harms, the Rome Call offered a way to show good faith engagement with ethical frameworks while maintaining flexibility in implementation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What did tech companies actually commit to by signing?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">By signing, companies committed to six principles: transparency (making AI explainable), inclusion (preventing discrimination), accountability (taking responsibility for AI decisions), impartiality (avoiding bias), reliability (ensuring systems work safely), and security/privacy (protecting users). These are voluntary commitments without legal enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance. However, they create reputational stakes—violating these publicly-stated principles would damage credibility and relationships with religious institutions, governments, and civil society. The commitments also influence corporate culture by legitimizing ethics discussions and empowering employees who advocate for responsible AI development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Has the Rome Call actually changed how tech companies build AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Evidence is mixed. Some signatory companies established AI ethics boards, increased transparency in documentation, and incorporated ethical review processes into product development. Microsoft and IBM have pointed to the Rome Call when describing their AI governance frameworks. However, critics note that voluntary commitments often lack teeth—companies continue deploying controversial AI systems, and enforcement mechanisms are weak. The real impact may be cultural and normative: the Rome Call legitimized treating AI as a moral issue requiring ethical oversight, not just technical optimization. It shifted industry discourse even if implementation remains incomplete and uneven across companies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why was the Vatican uniquely positioned as convener of the Rome Call?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican offered several unique advantages as convener. First, moral authority built over two millennia and global reach spanning every continent and culture. Second, complete independence from governments and corporations—the Holy See doesn't answer to shareholders or voters, allowing it to maintain neutrality. Third, historical perspective on how technological revolutions reshape society, having guided the Church through printing presses, industrial revolution, and nuclear weapons. Fourth, intellectual resources combining theology, philosophy, and engagement with cutting-edge science. Fifth, convening power that brought together tech CEOs, government officials, religious leaders, and academics who might not otherwise sit together. The Vatican could host conversations that no single nation or corporation could credibly convene.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What role did Pope Francis personally play in the Rome Call?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Francis was the driving intellectual and moral force behind the Rome Call. He had been warning about AI and automation years before ChatGPT made it mainstream—addressing these issues in encyclicals, speeches, and private meetings with tech leaders. Francis provided the moral vision that AI must serve human dignity and the common good, not just profit or efficiency. He lent his personal authority to bring reluctant tech leaders to Rome, making the Rome Call a priority for the Pontifical Academy for Life. His June 2024 address at the G7 summit on AI ethics demonstrated sustained commitment. Without Francis's leadership, the Rome Call likely would not have achieved the visibility or participation it did.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Did other religious leaders participate in the Rome Call?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. The Rome Call was explicitly interfaith from its inception. Jewish rabbis and Muslim leaders participated alongside Catholic officials, making it a multi-religious effort rather than purely Catholic initiative. This interfaith approach reinforced that the Rome Call addresses universal human values and ethical principles that transcend any single religious tradition. The participation of diverse faith leaders strengthened the moral weight of the declaration and its claim to speak for broadly-shared human dignity principles. It also made the Rome Call more accessible and relevant to diverse audiences globally, not just Catholic institutions or majority-Christian nations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How is the Rome Call different from government AI regulations?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Government regulations like the EU AI Act establish legally binding requirements with enforcement mechanisms and penalties for non-compliance. They operate through law, regulatory agencies, and courts. The Rome Call, by contrast, offers voluntary moral principles without legal force or enforcement. This difference is both weakness and strength. Weakness: no penalty for violation means commitments can be ignored. Strength: moral frameworks can move faster than legislative processes, influence corporate culture before laws exist, and shape what regulations should ultimately achieve. The two approaches complement each other—moral frameworks like the Rome Call inform what good regulation looks like, while regulations provide teeth that voluntary commitments lack.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Has the Rome Call influenced AI policy beyond tech companies?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, significantly. The Rome Call's principles have been cited in policy discussions at the OECD, United Nations, European Union, and national governments. Its language about human dignity, accountability, and the common good has become standard vocabulary in AI policy debates worldwide. The framework influenced UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of AI and informed discussions leading to the EU AI Act. Academic researchers cite it as a bridge between technical AI development and humanistic values. Its impact extends beyond the specific signatories to shape broader conversations about what responsible AI governance should look like. The Rome Call demonstrated that religious institutions could contribute substantively to cutting-edge technology policy, not just react to it.</p>

        <!-- PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS -->
        <div class="faq-section" id="practical">
            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How can Catholic institutions implement AI ethics in practice?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic institutions should start by establishing AI ethics review processes before deploying any AI systems. This includes: forming ethics committees that include theologians, ethicists, affected stakeholders, and technical experts; conducting impact assessments that evaluate effects on human dignity, the common good, and vulnerable populations; ensuring transparency about how AI systems make decisions; building in meaningful human oversight for consequential decisions; and regularly auditing systems for bias, fairness, and alignment with Catholic values. Catholic healthcare systems, universities, and social service organizations should view AI ethics not as compliance checkbox but as mission-critical work directly connected to their religious identity and service commitments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What questions should Catholics ask about AI systems they encounter?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholics should ask: Does this AI system treat people as subjects with dignity or as objects to optimize? These questions apply especially to emerging technologies like <a href="deepfakes-misinformation.html">deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation</a>. Who benefits from this system and who might be harmed? Can humans understand how it makes decisions? Is there meaningful human oversight, especially for consequential decisions? Does it reinforce or reduce existing inequalities? Could it be used to manipulate, surveil, or control people? What happens to people's data and privacy? Are workers being displaced without support? Does it strengthen or weaken human relationships and community? These questions help evaluate whether AI serves human flourishing and the common good or merely efficiency and profit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How should Catholic schools teach about AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic schools should integrate AI ethics throughout curriculum, not treat it as isolated topic. This means: in theology classes, connecting AI to Catholic social teaching on human dignity and the common good; in science and computer classes, teaching that technical decisions are moral decisions with human consequences; in history and social studies, examining how past technologies reshaped society; in literature and humanities, exploring what makes us distinctively human; and providing practical exercises where students evaluate real AI systems against ethical principles. The goal is forming students who can think critically about technology's relationship to human flourishing, not just consume it uncritically or master technical skills divorced from moral reflection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What role can Catholic organizations play in AI governance?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic organizations have unique contributions to make in AI governance. They can: serve as moral voice in policy debates, bringing principles of human dignity and common good; provide neutral convening spaces where different stakeholders can dialogue; conduct research connecting theological ethics to technical AI development; advocate for policies protecting vulnerable populations from AI harms; support workers and communities disrupted by automation; and model responsible AI deployment in their own institutions. Catholic healthcare networks, universities, relief organizations, and dioceses collectively reach billions of people globally, giving the Church significant potential influence in shaping how AI develops and deploys.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Where can I learn more about Catholic AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Key resources include: the Rome Call for AI Ethics document itself (available on the Vatican website); Pope Francis's addresses and writings on technology and automation, particularly sections of "Laudato Si'" and "Fratelli Tutti"; publications from the Pontifical Academy for Life; Catholic university programs in technology ethics at institutions like Notre Dame, Georgetown, and Boston College; the work of theologians and ethicists writing on AI from Catholic perspectives; and organizations like the Domus Communis Foundation Hungary that connect Catholic thought to practical technology governance. Reading papal social teaching documents like "Laborem Exercens" on work and "Centesimus Annus" on technology also provides essential ethical foundation for understanding the Church's AI positions.</p>
