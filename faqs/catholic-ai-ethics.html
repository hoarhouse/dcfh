                <h3 class="faq-question">What is Catholic AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic AI ethics is the application of Catholic moral teaching—particularly principles of human dignity, the common good, and social justice—to the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. It asks not just "can we build this?" but "should we build this?" and "who does it serve?" The framework prioritizes human flourishing over technological capability or profit, insisting that AI must serve people rather than replace or exploit them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How is Catholic AI ethics different from secular AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">While secular AI ethics often focuses on harm reduction, fairness, and transparency, Catholic ethics grounds these concerns in the inherent, God-given dignity of every human person. This means human worth is non-negotiable—it doesn't depend on productivity, intelligence, or economic value. Catholic teaching also emphasizes solidarity (we're responsible for each other) and the common good (technology should serve all of humanity, not just the powerful).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Does the Vatican oppose AI technology?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. The Vatican does not oppose AI technology itself. Pope Francis has stated that AI "can help to overcome ignorance and facilitate the exchange of information." The Church supports technological advancement but insists it must serve human dignity. The Vatican's concern is not with AI as a tool, but with how it's deployed—particularly when automation prioritizes profit over people.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does "human dignity" mean in the context of AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">In Catholic teaching, human dignity is the inherent worth of every person, regardless of their productivity, capabilities, or social status. For AI ethics, this means: systems cannot treat people as mere optimization variables; disabled, elderly, or economically "unproductive" people deserve equal consideration; human moral reasoning cannot be outsourced to algorithms; and people have the right to understand and contest decisions made about them. AI must respect each person as a subject with agency and conscience, not an object to be processed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can AI systems make moral decisions?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. Catholic teaching holds that moral decisions require conscience, empathy, the ability to recognize context and nuance, and the capacity to take moral responsibility for outcomes. AI systems, no matter how sophisticated, lack these qualities. They can calculate, optimize, and predict, but they cannot experience the weight of moral choice or be held truly accountable. This is why the Vatican insists that humans must retain final authority over consequential decisions, especially those involving life, death, justice, or human welfare.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the "common good" in AI ethics?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The common good is a core principle of Catholic social teaching, referring to conditions that allow all people and communities to flourish. For AI, this means technology should serve everyone's wellbeing, not just maximize profit or efficiency for a few. It requires: ensuring AI benefits reach marginalized communities; preventing wealth and power concentration among tech companies; protecting workers displaced by automation; and designing systems that strengthen rather than undermine social bonds and democratic participation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does "wisdom of the heart" mean?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Francis frequently uses this phrase to distinguish between information processing and genuine understanding. "Wisdom of the heart" means knowledge guided by love, empathy, and moral purpose—capacities AI cannot replicate. While AI excels at optimization and calculation, wisdom involves knowing what matters, recognizing what should not be sacrificed for efficiency, and understanding that human relationships and dignity are more important than data or profit. It's the difference between knowing how to build something and knowing why people need it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Does Catholic teaching say AI is inherently evil?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. Catholic teaching doesn't view technology as inherently good or evil—moral character comes from how it's designed, deployed, and used. AI is a tool, and like any tool, it inherits the intentions and values of its creators. The Church emphasizes that AI can serve human flourishing if developed with wisdom and guided by moral principles that prioritize human dignity. The danger isn't AI itself, but allowing technological capability to outpace ethical reflection, or letting profit motives override concern for human welfare.</p>
