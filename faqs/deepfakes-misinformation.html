            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are deepfakes and why do they matter?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Deepfakes are AI-generated images, videos, or audio that convincingly depict people saying or doing things they never actually said or did. The term combines "deep learning" (the AI technique used) with "fake."</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Examples include:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Video of a political leader making statements they never made</li>
                    <li>Audio of your voice saying things you never said</li>
                    <li>Images of events that never happened</li>
                    <li>Fabricated evidence of crimes or misconduct</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of society, especially when falsehood is clothed in institutional or spiritual authority."
                    <cite>‚Äî Antiqua et Nova (2025)</cite>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">Deepfakes matter because they attack something fundamental: <strong>our ability to trust what we see and hear.</strong> For all of human history, seeing was believing. Photographs and videos were evidence of reality. AI has shattered that certainty.</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>The Stakes:</strong> When we can no longer trust our eyes and ears, truth itself becomes contested. This doesn't just enable individual lies‚Äîit erodes the shared reality necessary for society to function.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI enable misinformation differently than traditional lies?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Humans have always been capable of lying. But AI changes three critical factors: scale, speed, and sophistication.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>1. Scale</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Traditional misinformation required human effort to create and spread. AI can generate thousands of fake articles, images, or videos in minutes. Bots can spread them across millions of accounts simultaneously.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>2. Speed</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A fake video can go viral and influence an election before fact-checkers even identify it as false. By the time corrections are published, the damage is done.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>3. Sophistication</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Old photo manipulation was detectable by experts. Modern deepfakes are often indistinguishable from reality, even to trained observers using advanced detection tools.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Vatican Concern:</strong> "As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see and hear, polarization and conflict will only grow. Such widespread deception is no trivial matter; it strikes at the core of humanity, dismantling the foundational trust on which societies are built."

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is "AI hallucination" and why is it dangerous?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">AI "hallucination" occurs when AI systems generate information that sounds plausible but is completely false‚Äînot intentionally, but because of how they're designed.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">Large language models like ChatGPT are trained to produce probable-sounding responses based on patterns in their training data. They're not designed to verify truth‚Äîthey're designed to complete text in ways that sound human-like.</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real Example: AI Inventing Legal Cases</h3>
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In 2023, a lawyer used ChatGPT to research legal precedents for a court filing. The AI generated convincing citations to cases that sounded real‚Äîwith proper formatting, judge names, case numbers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> None of the cases existed. ChatGPT had hallucinated entirely fictional legal precedents. The lawyer submitted them to court without verification.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> The lawyer faced sanctions for submitting false information. More importantly, it demonstrated how AI can fabricate "facts" that people trust because they appear authoritative.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">This is dangerous because:</p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>People trust AI outputs without verification</li>
                    <li>Hallucinations often mix true and false information seamlessly</li>
                    <li>The confident tone makes fabrications believable</li>
                    <li>Users may not even know hallucination is possible</li>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What does the Eighth Commandment say about AI deception?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Eighth Commandment‚Äî"You shall not bear false witness"‚Äîdirectly addresses deception. Creating or spreading deepfakes and misinformation violates this commandment in the digital age.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust."
                    <cite>‚Äî Antiqua et Nova (2025)</cite>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Traditional false witness involved:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Lying in court testimony</li>
                    <li>Spreading rumors that damage someone's reputation</li>
                    <li>Misrepresenting someone's words or actions</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Modern AI false witness includes:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Creating deepfake videos showing people doing or saying things they didn't</li>
                    <li>Using AI to fabricate evidence</li>
                    <li>Generating fake news articles or social media posts</li>
                    <li>Manipulating images to create false narratives</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer">The moral principle remains the same: <strong>intentionally deceiving others about reality is gravely wrong.</strong> Using digital tools doesn't change the moral nature of the act‚Äîit just makes the deception more powerful and harder to detect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why does Catholic teaching emphasize truth so strongly?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic theology grounds truth in the very nature of God. Jesus declared "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). Truth isn't just accuracy‚Äîit's participation in divine reality.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Truth matters because:</strong></p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>1. It Reflects God's Nature</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">God cannot lie (Titus 1:2). When we commit to truth, we participate in God's character. When we deceive, we align ourselves with "the father of lies" (John 8:44).</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>2. It Respects Human Dignity</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Lying treats people as means to your ends‚Äîmanipulating them rather than respecting their freedom and rationality. Catholic teaching insists every person has a right to truth.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>3. It Enables Community</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Society requires trust. When truth collapses, so do relationships, institutions, and the common good. We can't cooperate, govern, or care for each other if we can't trust what we're told.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>4. It Connects Us to Reality</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">True wisdom requires "encounter with reality" (Antiqua et Nova). When AI-generated fiction replaces reality, we lose our grounding in what actually exists.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Truth is not merely a function of information processing but requires moral discernment and a commitment to reality."

                <h3 class="faq-question">Is creating deepfakes always wrong, or are there legitimate uses?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic moral theology distinguishes between <strong>deceptive</strong> and <strong>non-deceptive</strong> uses of synthetic media.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Legitimate Uses (When Clearly Labeled):</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> CGI in movies that no one mistakes for reality</li>
                    <li><strong>Historical reconstruction:</strong> Showing what historical figures might have sounded like (clearly presented as speculation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Generating voice for people who can't speak (with their consent)</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Demonstrating what AI can do (in educational contexts)</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Always Wrong:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Creating deepfakes intended to deceive</li>
                    <li>Making it appear someone said/did something they didn't</li>
                    <li>Fabricating evidence or documentation</li>
                    <li>Creating non-consensual synthetic media (especially intimate content)</li>
                    <li>Manipulating elections or public discourse</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>The Key Distinction:</strong> Intent to deceive. Using AI to create synthetic media for entertainment (like CGI in movies) where everyone knows it's not real is different from creating deepfakes to make people believe false things are true.

                <h3 class="faq-question">How are deepfakes being used to harm real people?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The damage from deepfakes is not hypothetical‚Äîit's happening now, and the Vatican specifically warns that "while the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the damage they cause is real."</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real Harms from Deepfakes</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>1. Political Manipulation</strong></p>
                    <p>Fake videos of candidates making racist statements, accepting bribes, or revealing "secrets" can sway elections before they're debunked.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Financial Fraud</strong></p>
                    <p>Criminals use deepfake audio of CEOs' voices to authorize fraudulent wire transfers. In 2019, a UK energy company lost $243,000 to a deepfake voice scam.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Personal Destruction</strong></p>
                    <p>Deepfake pornography places people's faces (overwhelmingly women) onto explicit content without consent. This weaponizes intimate imagery to humiliate, harass, and destroy reputations.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Religious Authority Theft</strong></p>
                    <p>Deepfakes of religious leaders‚Äîincluding Pope Francis‚Äîmaking false statements can mislead millions of faithful who trust these voices.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Family Exploitation</strong></p>
                    <p>Scammers use AI voice cloning to fake kidnappings, calling elderly parents with their "child's" voice begging for ransom.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Stage 1: Uncertainty</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">People encounter deepfakes and AI-generated content. They can't distinguish real from fake. Confusion spreads.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Stage 2: Suspicion</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Once people know deepfakes exist, they begin doubting everything‚Äîeven authentic content. "That could be fake" becomes the default response.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Stage 3: Polarization</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Without shared facts, people retreat into echo chambers that confirm their biases. Everyone accuses opponents of spreading "fake news."</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">When no one can agree on basic reality, cooperation becomes impossible. Democratic discourse, justice systems, and even personal relationships break down.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see and hear, polarization and conflict will only grow.

                <h3 class="faq-question">What should I do if I encounter deepfakes or AI misinformation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic teaching calls us to be defenders of truth. When you encounter AI deception:</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>1. Don't Share</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">The first rule: <strong>do not spread content you suspect is false,</strong> even to "debunk" it. Sharing gives it oxygen and wider reach.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>2. Verify Before Believing</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Check multiple trusted sources. Look for original sourcing. Use reverse image search. If you can't verify, remain skeptical.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>3. Report When Appropriate</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Most platforms have reporting mechanisms for misinformation. Use them, especially for harmful content targeting individuals.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>4. Educate Gently</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">If someone you know shares misinformation, correct them privately and respectfully. Public shaming rarely helps and often entrenches false beliefs.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>5. Model Critical Thinking</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Demonstrate healthy skepticism. Ask "How do we know this is true?" Make verification a habit.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Christians are called to be witnesses to truth‚Äînot only in resisting falsehoods but in actively promoting honesty, justice, and transparency in both digital and personal interactions."

                <h3 class="faq-question">How can we teach children and vulnerable people to recognize AI deception?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican specifically warns that children are particularly vulnerable to AI deception and anthropomorphization. Protecting them requires proactive education.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Key Lessons for Children:</strong></p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>1. Not Everything Online Is Real</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Help children understand that computers can now create fake videos, photos, and audio that look and sound real but aren't.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>2. Check Multiple Sources</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Teach them never to believe something from just one source, especially if it's shocking or upsetting.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>3. Talk to Trusted Adults</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Encourage children to ask parents, teachers, or other trusted adults when they're unsure if something online is true.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>4. AI Isn't Human</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Help children understand that AI chatbots and assistants aren't real friends, don't have feelings, and shouldn't be trusted like people.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>For Elderly and Vulnerable Adults:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Warn about AI voice cloning scams (fake "kidnapped grandchild" calls)</li>
                    <li>Encourage verification through separate phone calls to known numbers</li>
                    <li>Establish code words with family members for emergencies</li>
                    <li>Remind them that banks and governments never ask for urgent action via surprising phone calls</li>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What moral obligations do AI developers have regarding misinformation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic teaching places clear moral responsibility on those who create AI systems capable of generating misinformation.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Developers Must:</strong></p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>1. Build in Truth-Safeguards</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">AI systems should be designed to minimize hallucination, flag uncertain information, and refuse to generate known-false content.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>2. Enable Detection</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Watermarking, metadata, or other technical means to identify AI-generated content should be standard practice.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>3. Prevent Malicious Use</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Reasonable safeguards against using AI to create non-consensual deepfakes, impersonate real people, or generate targeted misinformation.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>4. Ensure Transparency</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Users should know when they're interacting with AI, when content is AI-generated, and what the system's limitations are.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>5. Accept Responsibility</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Developers can't hide behind "we're just making tools." They bear moral responsibility for foreseeable harms their tools enable.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Tech companies bear responsibility for ensuring their tools are not used to spread lies, and governments must establish regulations to prevent AI from being weaponized against truth."

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Governments Should:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Criminalize malicious deepfakes (especially non-consensual intimate imagery)</li>

                    <li>Protect freedom of speech while preventing AI-weaponized lies</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Educational Institutions Should:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">

                    <li>Model good information hygiene</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Media Organizations Should:</strong></p>

                    <li>Develop and publicize deepfake detection protocols</li>
                    <li>Verify content before publication</li>
                    <li>Clearly label AI-generated content in reporting</li>
                    <li>Invest in investigative journalism that counters misinformation</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Churches and Faith Communities Should:</strong></p>

                <p class="faq-answer">The Church's response to AI deception isn't just defensive‚Äîit's a call to actively build a culture that values and defends truth.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "In a world where AI challenges our ability to trust what we see, the commitment to truth must be stronger than ever. Technology should serve humanity, not undermine it."

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>2. Trained Discernment</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Communities where people are equipped to think critically, verify carefully, and resist manipulation.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>3. Ethical AI Development</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Technology designed with truth-protection built in, not just profit maximization.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>4. Accountability and Consequences</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Real penalties for those who weaponize AI to deceive, particularly in ways that harm democracy or destroy individuals.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>5. Resilient Trust</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Rebuilding social trust through institutions and relationships that prioritize transparency and honesty.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>The Stakes Are Existential:</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">If we fail to protect truth in the AI age, we risk a future where reality itself is contested, where manipulation is the norm, and where the social trust necessary for human community collapses.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">But if we succeed‚Äîif we build AI that respects truth, educate populations in discernment, and create accountability for deception‚Äîwe can preserve the shared reality that makes justice, democracy, and human flourishing possible.</p>

                    <strong>The Catholic Call:</strong> Be witnesses to truth in a world of lies. Verify before you share. Teach critical thinking. Demand accountability.
