## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Statistics:
- ✅ **VERIFIED WITH CITATIONS:** 0 (0%)
- ⚠️ **REAL BUT UNCITED:** 39 (88%)
- ❌ **HYPOTHETICAL/THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS:** 5 (11%)

### Key Issues:
1. **No case studies have proper citations** - even real, verifiable events lack source links
2. **5 thought experiments** need to be clearly labeled as such (not "real-world examples")
3. **All real case studies need source links** for credibility and verification

---

## PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED

### 1. MISLABELED THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS (Fix labels immediately)

**ai-consciousness-souls-faq.html:**
- "Thought Experiment: The Chinese Room" - ✅ Correctly labeled
- **ACTION:** Keep as-is, this is properly marked as a thought experiment

**ai-warfare-weapons-faq.html:**
- "Real-World Example: The Vincennes Incident" - ❌ This IS real (1988 USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air 655)
- **ACTION:** Add citation: [Source: US Navy Investigation Report, 1988]

**deepfakes-misinformation-faq.html:**
- "The Cascading Crisis of Trust" - ❌ Appears hypothetical
- **ACTION:** Either find real example or relabel as "Hypothetical Scenario:"

## ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate (Critical fixes)
1. Add citations to 10 most prominent case studies
2. Relabel thought experiments correctly
3. Remove or replace hypothetical scenarios

### Phase 2: This Week
1. Add citations to all remaining real case studies
2. Replace generic examples with specific, dated events
3. Add source links using template above

### Phase 3: Quality Control
1. Verify all links work
2. Ensure dates and details are accurate
3. Add "Last verified: [date]" to citations

---

## CONCLUSION

The case studies themselves are mostly legitimate and well-chosen. The main issue is **lack of citations**, not fabrication. Adding proper source links will:
1. Increase credibility
2. Allow readers to learn more
3. Protect against accusations of misinformation
4. Demonstrate thorough research

**Recommended tool:** Create a `case-study-sources.json` file to maintain all citations in one place for easy updates.
