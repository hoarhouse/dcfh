            <h2>Understanding AI Deception</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are deepfakes and why do they matter?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Deepfakes are AI-generated images, videos, or audio that convincingly depict people saying or doing things they never actually said or did. The term combines "deep learning" (the AI technique used) with "fake."</p>
                
                <p class="faq-answer">Examples include:</p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Video of a political leader making statements they never made</li>
                    <li>Audio of your voice saying things you never said</li>
                    <li>Images of events that never happened</li>
                    <li>Fabricated evidence of crimes or misconduct</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer">Deepfakes matter because they attack something fundamental: our ability to trust what we see and hear. For all of human history, seeing was believing. Photographs and videos were evidence of reality. AI has shattered that certainty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI enable misinformation differently than traditional lies?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Humans have always been capable of lying. But AI changes three critical factors: scale, speed, and sophistication.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Scale:</strong> Traditional misinformation required human effort to create and spread. AI can generate thousands of fake articles, images, or videos in minutes. Bots can spread them across millions of accounts simultaneously.
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Speed:</strong> A fake video can go viral and influence an election before fact-checkers even identify it as false. By the time corrections are published, the damage is done.
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Sophistication:</strong> Old photo manipulation was detectable by experts. Modern deepfakes are often indistinguishable from reality, even to trained observers using advanced detection tools.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is "AI hallucination" and why is it dangerous?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">AI "hallucination" occurs when AI systems generate information that sounds plausible but is completely falseâ€”not intentionally, but because of how they're designed.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">Large language models are trained to produce probable-sounding responses based on patterns in their training data. They're not designed to verify truthâ€”they're designed to complete text in ways that sound human-like.</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real Example: AI Inventing Legal Cases</h3>
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In 2023, a lawyer used ChatGPT to research legal precedents. The AI generated convincing citations with proper formatting, judge names, and case numbers.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> None of the cases existed. ChatGPT had hallucinated entirely fictional legal precedents.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> The lawyer faced sanctions, demonstrating how AI can fabricate "facts" that people trust because they appear authoritative.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">This is dangerous because people trust AI outputs without verification, hallucinations mix true and false information seamlessly, and users may not even know hallucination is possible.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ Section 2 -->
        <div class="faq-section" id="section2">
            <h2>Catholic Teaching on Truth</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does the Eighth Commandment say about AI deception?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Eighth Commandmentâ€”"You shall not bear false witness"â€”directly addresses deception. Creating or spreading deepfakes and misinformation violates this commandment in the digital age.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">The moral principle remains the same: intentionally deceiving others about reality is gravely wrong. Using digital tools doesn't change the moral nature of the actâ€”it just makes the deception more powerful and harder to detect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why does Catholic teaching emphasize truth so strongly?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic theology grounds truth in the very nature of God. Jesus declared "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "God cannot lie (Titus 1:2). When we commit to truth, we participate in God's character. When we deceive, we align ourselves with 'the father of lies' (John 8:44)."
                    <cite>â€” Catholic Catechism</cite>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">Truth matters because it reflects God's nature, respects human dignity, enables community, and connects us to reality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Is creating deepfakes always wrong, or are there legitimate uses?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic moral theology distinguishes between deceptive and non-deceptive uses of synthetic media.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Legitimate Uses (When Clearly Labeled):</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Entertainment: CGI in movies that no one mistakes for reality</li>
                    <li>Historical reconstruction: Showing what historical figures might have sounded like</li>
                    <li>Accessibility: Generating voice for people who can't speak (with consent)</li>
                    <li>Education: Demonstrating what AI can do in educational contexts</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Always Wrong:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li>Creating deepfakes intended to deceive</li>
                    <li>Making it appear someone said/did something they didn't</li>
                    <li>Fabricating evidence or documentation</li>
                    <li>Creating non-consensual synthetic media</li>
                    <li>Manipulating elections or public discourse</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How are deepfakes being used to harm real people?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican warns that "while the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the damage they cause is real."</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real Harms from Deepfakes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Political Manipulation:</strong> Fake videos can sway elections before they're debunked.</p>
                    <p><strong>Financial Fraud:</strong> In 2019, a UK energy company lost $243,000 to a deepfake voice scam.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personal Destruction:</strong> Deepfake pornography weaponizes intimate imagery to humiliate and harass.</p>
                    <p><strong>Religious Authority Theft:</strong> Deepfakes of Pope Francis making false statements can mislead millions.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What about AI misinformation in elections?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Elections are particularly vulnerable because timing matters. A false story released days before voting can influence outcomes before it's debunked.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">AI enables election manipulation through fake candidate content, synthetic evidence, micro-targeted lies, and flooding the zone with so much false content that truth can't keep up.</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>The Cascading Crisis of Trust</h3>
                    <p><strong>Stage 1 - Uncertainty:</strong> People can't distinguish real from fake. Confusion spreads.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 2 - Suspicion:</strong> People begin doubting everythingâ€”even authentic content.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 3 - Polarization:</strong> Without shared facts, people retreat into echo chambers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 4 - Social Collapse:</strong> When no one can agree on basic reality, cooperation becomes impossible.</p>
