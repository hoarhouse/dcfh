                <p class="faq-answer">In 2025, <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Paul Gallagher delivered a statement</a> at a UN Security Council open debate on artificial intelligence and international security. As the Vatican's Secretary for Relations with States (equivalent to foreign minister), Archbishop Gallagher presented the Holy See's position on AI's threats to global peace and security, with particular focus on autonomous weapons systems, AI-enabled surveillance and repression, algorithmic warfare, and the need for international governance frameworks. The statement represents the Vatican's diplomatic engagement at the highest level of international security discussions.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why did the Vatican address the UN Security Council on AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican addresses the Security Council because AI represents a profound threat to international peace and security‚Äîthe Council's core mandate. <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Gallagher's statement</a> emphasizes that autonomous weapons, AI-powered surveillance enabling repression, algorithmic manipulation of information, and AI arms races threaten global stability as significantly as nuclear weapons once did. The Holy See, as a permanent observer state at the UN with moral authority transcending national interests, is uniquely positioned to advocate for international cooperation on AI governance before catastrophic use occurs. This builds on <a href="../vatican-resources/participation-of-the-holy-father-francis-at-the-g7-in-borgo-egnazia-puglia-14-june-2024.html">Pope Francis's G7 warnings</a>.</p>

The statement positions AI weapons control alongside nuclear arms control as essential to global security.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the Vatican's position on autonomous weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer"><a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Gallagher's statement</a> calls for an absolute ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS)‚Äîweapons that can select and engage targets without meaningful human control. The Vatican argues these systems are inherently immoral because: (1) they delegate life-and-death decisions to machines incapable of moral judgment; (2) they erode human responsibility and accountability for killing; (3) they lower the threshold for conflict by removing human psychological barriers to violence; (4) they threaten to make war "too easy" by eliminating human risk; (5) they violate human dignity by allowing algorithms to determine who lives or dies. This position aligns with <a href="../vatican-resources/lvii-world-day-of-peace-2024-artificial-intelligence-and-peace.html">the 2024 Peace Day message</a>.</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real-World Challenge: The Autonomous Weapons Arms Race</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Multiple nations are developing autonomous weapons systems. Without international agreement, an arms race seems inevitable, with each nation fearing being left behind.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vatican Principle:</strong> Just as the world eventually banned chemical and biological weapons despite initial resistance, autonomous weapons must be prohibited through binding international treaty before widespread deployment makes control impossible.</p>

This means: (1) humans must understand what the system will do and why; (2) humans must have sufficient information and time to make informed decisions; (3) humans must be able to override system decisions in real-time; (4) systems must not operate too fast for human comprehension; (5) accountability must rest with identifiable human decision-makers. AI can assist, but never replace, human moral judgment in life-and-death decisions.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI affect cyber warfare and information operations?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Gallagher</a>, AI enables cyber warfare and information operations at unprecedented scale: automated hacking and infrastructure attacks, AI-generated disinformation campaigns, deepfakes undermining trust in evidence, algorithmic manipulation of public opinion, and targeting of critical systems. These capabilities threaten not just military targets but civilian infrastructure, democratic processes, and social cohesion. The Vatican calls for extending international humanitarian law and norms of warfare to cyber and information domains, prohibiting AI attacks on civilian systems and democratic processes.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">statement warns</a> that AI-powered surveillance‚Äîfacial recognition, behavior prediction, social credit systems, and automated repression‚Äîthreatens international security by enabling authoritarian control and human rights violations. When states use AI to monitor, control, and repress populations, it creates instability, drives migration crises, and undermines the international human rights framework essential to peace. The Vatican calls for international restrictions on surveillance technologies' export and use, particularly systems designed for mass monitoring and social control, connecting to <a href="vatican-common-good-digital-age-2019-faq.html">common good principles</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Why does the Vatican emphasize binding treaties over voluntary principles?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Vatican argues</a> that voluntary principles, while useful, are insufficient for security threats. When national security and military advantage are at stake, states won't voluntarily forgo dangerous capabilities unless assured competitors are similarly constrained. Binding treaties create: (1) legal obligations with international enforcement; (2) verification requirements providing transparency; (3) consequences for violations deterring non-compliance; (4) level playing field preventing arms races; (5) legitimacy for international intervention when violations occur. The stakes‚Äîautonomous weapons, AI-enabled mass destruction‚Äîdemand legal frameworks, not just good intentions, as emphasized in <a href="vatican-rome-call-ai-ethics-faq.html">the Rome Call</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How should existing international law apply to AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">the Vatican statement</a>, existing international humanitarian law fully applies to AI systems: (1) <strong>Distinction principle</strong>‚Äîsystems must distinguish combatants from civilians; (2) <strong>Proportionality</strong>‚Äîattacks must not cause excessive civilian harm relative to military advantage; (3) <strong>Precaution</strong>‚Äîall feasible measures must protect civilians; (4) <strong>Accountability</strong>‚Äîindividuals must be responsible for violations; (5) <strong>Prohibition of weapons causing unnecessary suffering</strong>. Many AI systems cannot reliably comply with these requirements, making their military use illegal. New treaties should clarify application and close loopholes, not create exceptions weakening humanitarian protections.</p>

The UN's universal membership and existing structures make it the appropriate forum for international AI governance, though new institutions may be needed for technical oversight.</p>

True security comes through international cooperation and adherence to humanitarian principles, not through autonomous weapons arms races that threaten humanity. This aligns with <a href="../vatican-resources/lvii-world-day-of-peace-2024-artificial-intelligence-and-peace.html">the peace and security framework</a>.</p>
