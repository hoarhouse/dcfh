            "text": "The Vatican's 2025 address to the UN Security Council on artificial intelligence represents a historic intervention linking AI development directly to international peace and security. Delivered as AI weapons systems proliferate and cyber warfare intensifies, the statement calls for immediate action to prevent an AI arms race that could destabilize global security. The Vatican argues that AI's military applications—from autonomous weapons to information warfare—pose existential risks requiring Security Council leadership. The address combines moral authority with practical proposals for international governance, warning that without binding agreements, AI could enable unprecedented violence and oppression."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican recognized that AI has become a critical security issue requiring the Security Council's unique authority to maintain international peace. As nations race to develop military AI capabilities without international oversight, the risk of accidental escalation, loss of human control over violence, and AI-enabled mass atrocities grows exponentially. The Holy See used its observer status to provide moral leadership, arguing that technical discussions of AI must be grounded in ethical principles protecting human dignity. The timing reflects urgency—autonomous weapons are being deployed, cyber attacks using AI are increasing, and the window for meaningful regulation is closing."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "This marks the first comprehensive religious perspective on AI presented to the Security Council, elevating AI governance from technical issue to moral imperative. The statement is significant for: linking AI directly to the Security Council's peace mandate; proposing concrete governance mechanisms beyond voluntary principles; uniting moral authority with geopolitical reality; addressing both state and non-state AI threats; and calling for preemptive action before AI weapons proliferate beyond control. The Vatican's intervention gives moral weight to technical discussions often dominated by strategic and economic considerations."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican categorically opposes fully autonomous weapons systems that can select and engage targets without human intervention. The Church argues these violate human dignity by reducing life-and-death decisions to algorithms, removing human moral agency from acts of violence. The statement calls for: immediate moratorium on developing and deploying lethal autonomous weapons; binding international treaty prohibiting fully autonomous systems; mandatory meaningful human control over all weapons; and accountability mechanisms ensuring humans remain responsible for violence. The Vatican warns that crossing the threshold to machines making kill decisions represents a fundamental breach of moral law."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican defines meaningful human control as more than token human presence in the decision loop. True control requires: human understanding of the system's capabilities and limitations; ability to intervene and abort actions; time for ethical reflection and judgment; clear accountability for outcomes; and preservation of human moral agency. The statement rejects superficial compliance where humans merely rubber-stamp algorithmic decisions. Speed of warfare cannot justify removing human judgment from life-and-death choices. The Church argues that if a system operates too fast for human control, it shouldn't be deployed."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican warns that AI exponentially increases cyber warfare's destructive potential through: automated vulnerability discovery and exploitation; AI-generated disinformation indistinguishable from truth; deepfakes undermining trust in evidence and leadership; algorithmic manipulation of public opinion at scale; and cyber attacks that adapt faster than human defenders can respond. The statement emphasizes that AI-powered information warfare can destabilize societies without firing a shot, undermining democracy, inciting violence, and destroying social cohesion. The Church calls for treating AI-enabled information attacks as serious as kinetic warfare."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican condemns AI surveillance systems that enable mass repression, particularly when exported to authoritarian regimes. The statement addresses: facial recognition systems tracking citizens without consent; predictive policing targeting dissidents and minorities; social credit systems controlling behavior through algorithmic judgment; AI-enabled censorship suppressing freedom of expression; and biometric surveillance creating permanent digital prisons. The Church argues that AI surveillance violates human dignity, freedom, and the right to privacy. Democratic nations must not profit from selling surveillance technology that enables oppression."

The proposal emphasizes enforceability over voluntary guidelines."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican argues that voluntary principles have failed to prevent AI militarization, as nations fear competitive disadvantage from unilateral restraint. Only binding treaties with verification mechanisms can overcome the prisoner's dilemma of the AI arms race. The statement notes that humanity successfully banned chemical and biological weapons through enforceable treaties, not voluntary codes. With AI's potential for autonomous violence and mass surveillance, stakes are too high for self-regulation. The Church emphasizes that protecting human dignity requires law, not just goodwill."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican affirms that international humanitarian law, human rights law, and the UN Charter fully apply to AI systems. This means: AI weapons must distinguish combatants from civilians; autonomous systems cannot commit war crimes; AI surveillance must respect human rights; and states remain responsible for their AI systems' actions. However, the statement argues existing law needs updating for AI's unique challenges—current frameworks didn't anticipate machines making independent targeting decisions or AI systems that evolve unpredictably. New protocols must clarify how fundamental legal principles apply to artificial agents."

The Church argues the UN's legitimacy and universality make it the only institution capable of managing AI's global implications."

The statement emphasizes that delay means losing control—action must be taken while human governance of AI remains possible."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Vatican acknowledges legitimate security concerns while arguing that uncontrolled AI development increases rather than reduces threats. True security requires: multilateral agreements preventing AI arms races; defensive AI capabilities that don't require offensive escalation; transparency building trust between nations; shared verification technologies ensuring compliance; and focus on AI for peacekeeping and conflict prevention rather than warfare. The statement argues that just as nuclear arms control enhanced rather than undermined security, AI governance can create stability while preserving legitimate defense."

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the 2025 UN Security Council AI statement?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">In 2025, <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Paul Gallagher delivered a statement</a> at a UN Security Council open debate on artificial intelligence and international security. As the Vatican's Secretary for Relations with States (equivalent to foreign minister), Archbishop Gallagher presented the Holy See's position on AI's threats to global peace and security, with particular focus on autonomous weapons systems, AI-enabled surveillance and repression, algorithmic warfare, and the need for international governance frameworks. The statement represents the Vatican's diplomatic engagement at the highest level of international security discussions.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Why did the Vatican address the UN Security Council on AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican addresses the Security Council because AI represents a profound threat to international peace and security—the Council's core mandate. <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Gallagher's statement</a> emphasizes that autonomous weapons, AI-powered surveillance enabling repression, algorithmic manipulation of information, and AI arms races threaten global stability as significantly as nuclear weapons once did. The Holy See, as a permanent observer state at the UN with moral authority transcending national interests, is uniquely positioned to advocate for international cooperation on AI governance before catastrophic use occurs. This builds on <a href="../vatican-resources/participation-of-the-holy-father-francis-at-the-g7-in-borgo-egnazia-puglia-14-june-2024.html">Pope Francis's G7 warnings</a>.</p>

The statement positions AI weapons control alongside nuclear arms control as essential to global security.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Gallagher's statement</a> calls for an absolute ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS)—weapons that can select and engage targets without meaningful human control. The Vatican argues these systems are inherently immoral because: (1) they delegate life-and-death decisions to machines incapable of moral judgment; (2) they erode human responsibility and accountability for killing; (3) they lower the threshold for conflict by removing human psychological barriers to violence; (4) they threaten to make war "too easy" by eliminating human risk; (5) they violate human dignity by allowing algorithms to determine who lives or dies. This position aligns with <a href="../vatican-resources/lvii-world-day-of-peace-2024-artificial-intelligence-and-peace.html">the 2024 Peace Day message</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Real-World Challenge: The Autonomous Weapons Arms Race</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Multiple nations are developing autonomous weapons systems. Without international agreement, an arms race seems inevitable, with each nation fearing being left behind.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vatican Principle:</strong> Just as the world eventually banned chemical and biological weapons despite initial resistance, autonomous weapons must be prohibited through binding international treaty before widespread deployment makes control impossible.</p>

                    <h4>🌐 UN Secretary-General's AI Advisory Body Formation (2024)</h4>
                    <p>In October 2023, UN Secretary-General António Guterres established a high-level AI Advisory Body comprising 39 members from government, private sector, academia, and civil society to provide recommendations on AI's international governance. The body's 2024 interim report "Governing AI for Humanity" identified critical governance gaps: no binding international agreements on military AI, fragmented national regulations creating regulatory arbitrage, lack of mechanisms for cross-border AI incident response, and absence of verification systems for AI compliance. The body recommended establishing an International AI Governance Organization modeled on the IAEA, creating binding protocols for high-risk AI applications, and developing technical standards for AI transparency and accountability. However, the recommendations faced resistance from major powers unwilling to constrain military AI development. The Advisory Body's experience demonstrates both the urgent need for global AI governance and the political obstacles to achieving it, validating the Vatican's call for moral leadership to overcome narrow national interests in establishing effective AI governance frameworks.</p>

                    <h4>⚖️ OECD AI Principles Global Adoption (2019-2024)</h4>
                    <p>The OECD AI Principles, adopted in May 2019 and subsequently endorsed by over 50 countries including all G20 members, represent the first intergovernmental standard on AI but also reveal limitations of voluntary frameworks. The principles establish values-based guidance including inclusive growth, sustainable development, human-centered values, fairness, transparency, robustness, and accountability. By 2024, 42 countries had developed national AI strategies referencing OECD principles, and the OECD AI Policy Observatory tracked over 700 AI policy initiatives globally. However, implementation varies dramatically: while EU countries translated principles into binding regulations through the AI Act, other nations treated them as aspirational guidelines. Military AI remains explicitly excluded from the framework. Compliance is voluntary with no enforcement mechanisms. The OECD experience demonstrates that while soft law can build consensus and norms, the Vatican's call for binding treaties reflects recognition that voluntary principles alone cannot govern high-stakes AI applications, particularly in security domains where competitive pressures overwhelm ethical commitments without enforceable constraints.</p>

This means: (1) humans must understand what the system will do and why; (2) humans must have sufficient information and time to make informed decisions; (3) humans must be able to override system decisions in real-time; (4) systems must not operate too fast for human comprehension; (5) accountability must rest with identifiable human decision-makers.

                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI affect cyber warfare and information operations?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">Archbishop Gallagher</a>, AI enables cyber warfare and information operations at unprecedented scale: automated hacking and infrastructure attacks, AI-generated disinformation campaigns, deepfakes undermining trust in evidence, algorithmic manipulation of public opinion, and targeting of critical systems. These capabilities threaten not just military targets but civilian infrastructure, democratic processes, and social cohesion. The Vatican calls for extending international humanitarian law and norms of warfare to cyber and information domains, prohibiting AI attacks on civilian systems and democratic processes.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">statement warns</a> that AI-powered surveillance—facial recognition, behavior prediction, social credit systems, and automated repression—threatens international security by enabling authoritarian control and human rights violations. When states use AI to monitor, control, and repress populations, it creates instability, drives migration crises, and undermines the international human rights framework essential to peace. The Vatican calls for international restrictions on surveillance technologies' export and use, particularly systems designed for mass monitoring and social control, connecting to <a href="vatican-common-good-digital-age-2019-faq.html">common good principles</a>.</p>

When national security and military advantage are at stake, states won't voluntarily forgo dangerous capabilities unless assured competitors are similarly constrained. Binding treaties create: (1) legal obligations with international enforcement; (2) verification requirements providing transparency; (3) consequences for violations deterring non-compliance; (4) level playing field preventing arms races; (5) legitimacy for international intervention when violations occur. The stakes—autonomous weapons, AI-enabled mass destruction—demand legal frameworks, not just good intentions, as emphasized in <a href="vatican-rome-call-ai-ethics-faq.html">the Rome Call</a>.</p>

Many AI systems cannot reliably comply with these requirements, making their military use illegal. New treaties should clarify application and close loopholes, not create exceptions weakening humanitarian protections.</p>
