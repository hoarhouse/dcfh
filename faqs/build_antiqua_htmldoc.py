            <div class="htmldoc-section" id="introduction">
                <h2>I. Introduction: Wisdom Ancient and New</h2>
                
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß1.</span> With wisdom both ancient and new (cf. Mt. 13:52), we are called to reflect on the current challenges and opportunities posed by scientific and technological advancements, particularly by the recent development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Christian tradition regards the gift of intelligence as an essential aspect of how humans are created "in the image of God" (Gen. 1:27).</p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß2.</span> The Church encourages the advancement of science, technology, the arts, and other forms of human endeavor, viewing them as part of the "collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation." Human abilities and creativity come from God and, when used rightly, glorify God by reflecting his wisdom and goodness.</p>

                <div class="htmldoc-key-teaching">
                    <h4>Key Teaching</h4>
                    <p>"Technological progress is part of God's plan for creation, but people must take responsibility for using technologies like artificial intelligence to help humanity and not harm individuals or groups."</p>
                </div>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß4.</span> There is broad consensus that AI marks a new and significant phase in humanity's engagement with technology, placing it at the heart of what Pope Francis has described as an "epochal change." Its impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- SECTION II: WHAT IS AI -->
            <div class="htmldoc-section" id="what-is-ai">
                <h2>II. What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß7.</span> The concept of "intelligence" in AI has evolved over time, drawing on a range of ideas from various disciplines. A significant milestone occurred in 1956 when John McCarthy defined Artificial Intelligence as "that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving."</p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß8.</span> Since then, AI research has advanced rapidly, leading to the development of complex systems capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks. These "narrow AI" systems are typically designed to handle specific and limited functions, such as translating languages, predicting weather, classifying images, or generating visual content.</p>

                <div class="htmldoc-warning">
                    <h4>Critical Distinction</h4>
                    <p><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß12.</span> <strong>AI's advanced features give it sophisticated abilities to perform tasks, but not the ability to think.</strong> This distinction is crucially important, as the way "intelligence" is defined inevitably shapes how we understand the relationship between human thought and this technology.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß35.</span> As Pope Francis observes, "the very use of the word 'intelligence'" in connection with AI "can prove misleading" and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person. <strong>AI should not be seen as an artificial form of human intelligence but as a product of it.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <!-- SECTION III: HUMAN INTELLIGENCE -->
            <div class="htmldoc-section" id="human-intelligence">
                <h2>III. Intelligence in the Philosophical and Theological Tradition</h2>
                
                <h3>Rationality</h3>
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß13.</span> From the dawn of human self-reflection, the mind has played a central role in understanding what it means to be "human." Aristotle observed that "all people by nature desire to know." This knowledge, with its capacity for abstraction that grasps the nature and meaning of things, sets humans apart from the animal world.</p>

                <h3>Embodiment</h3>
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß16.</span> Christian thought considers the intellectual faculties of the human person within the framework of an integral anthropology that views the human being as essentially embodied. The entire human person is simultaneously both material and spiritual.</p>

                <div class="htmldoc-blockquote">
                    "The soul is not merely the immaterial 'part' of the person contained within the body, nor is the body an outer shell housing an intangible 'core.' Rather, the entire human person is simultaneously both material and spiritual." (¬ß16)
                </div>

                <h3>Relationality</h3>
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß18.</span> Human beings are "ordered by their very nature to interpersonal communion," possessing the capacity to know one another, to give themselves in love, and to enter into communion with others. Human intelligence is not an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships.</p>

                <h3>An Integral Understanding of Human Intelligence</h3>
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß29.</span> A proper understanding of human intelligence cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the person's openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation toward the True and the Good.</p>

                <div class="htmldoc-key-teaching">
                    <h4>Essential Teaching on Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>"True intelligence is shaped by divine love, which 'is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit' (Rom. 5:5). Human intelligence possesses an essential contemplative dimension, an unselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, beyond any utilitarian purpose." (¬ß29)</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Limits of AI</h3>
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß30-34.</span> While AI can perform sophisticated tasks, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework. Human intelligence, in contrast:</p>

Nevertheless, not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress. The Church is particularly opposed to those applications that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.</p>

                <div class="htmldoc-key-teaching">
                    <h4>Moral Responsibility</h4>
                    <p><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß39.</span> "Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral agent‚Äîa subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their consequences. Only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation."</p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß42.</span> The ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good.</p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß44.</span> Since full moral causality belongs only to personal agents, not artificial ones, it is crucial to be able to identify and define who bears responsibility for the processes involved in AI. <strong>Ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI must rest with human decision-makers.</strong></p>

                    <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß53.</span> The concentration of power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns.

                    <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß70.</span> Since work is "part of the meaning of life on this earth, a path to growth, human development and personal fulfillment," <strong>the goal should not be that technological progress increasingly replaces human work, for this would be detrimental to humanity‚Äîrather, it should promote human labor.</strong></p>

                    <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß81.</span> The extensive use of AI in education could lead to students' increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens.</p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß108.</span> Pope Francis emphasized the need for growth in "human responsibility, values, and conscience," proportionate to the growth in technological potential‚Äîrecognizing that "with an increase in human power comes a broadening of responsibility on the part of individuals and communities."</p>

                <div class="htmldoc-blockquote">
                    "The essential and fundamental question remains whether in the context of this progress man, as man, is becoming truly better‚Äîmore mature spiritually, more aware of the dignity of his humanity, more responsible, more open to others, especially the neediest and weakest, and readier to give and to aid all."

                </div>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß112.</span> A further point is the call for renewed appreciation of all that is human. The rapid pace of digitization risks a "digital reductionism," where non-quantifiable aspects of life are set aside. <strong>AI should be used only as a tool to complement human intelligence rather than replace its richness.</strong></p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß116.</span> Since "a person's perfection is measured not by the information or knowledge they possess, but by the depth of their charity," how we incorporate AI "to include the least of our brothers and sisters, the vulnerable, and those most in need, will be the true measure of our humanity."</p>

                    <p><span class="paragraph-number">¬ß117.</span> From the perspective of wisdom, believers will be able to act as moral agents capable of using this technology to promote an authentic vision of the human person and society.
