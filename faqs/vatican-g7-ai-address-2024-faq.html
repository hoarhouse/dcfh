                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Francis's <a href="../vatican-resources/participation-of-the-holy-father-francis-at-the-g7-in-borgo-egnazia-puglia-14-june-2024.html">June 2024 address at the G7 summit</a> in Borgo Egnazia, Italy, marked the first time in history that a pope addressed the G7 leaders, and the address was dedicated entirely to artificial intelligence. This unprecedented papal intervention demonstrated the Vatican's assessment that AI governance requires urgent moral leadership at the highest levels of global power. The pope spoke directly to leaders of the world's major democracies about their responsibility to ensure AI serves humanity.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why did Pope Francis choose to address G7 leaders specifically?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Francis addressed the G7 because these nations‚Äîrepresenting the world's major democracies and economies‚Äîhave the greatest capacity to shape global AI development and regulation. As detailed in <a href="../vatican-resources/participation-of-the-holy-father-francis-at-the-g7-in-borgo-egnazia-puglia-14-june-2024.html">his address</a>, the pope recognized that meaningful AI governance requires coordinated action by nations with the technological capability, economic resources, and political influence to establish international standards. The G7 summit provided a critical opportunity to call for collective moral leadership on AI.</p>

This audience represented decision-makers with direct authority over AI policy, regulation, and investment in the world's most technologically advanced nations. The pope's message was crafted specifically for those with the power to implement ethical AI frameworks.</p>

He called for international cooperation on AI governance, emphasized that certain AI applications‚Äîparticularly autonomous weapons‚Äîmust be prohibited, and warned that market forces alone will not ensure AI benefits humanity. The pope urged leaders to exercise moral courage in regulating AI.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Did Pope Francis oppose AI technology itself?</h3>

The pope acknowledged AI's potential benefits for healthcare, education, scientific research, and solving global challenges. His concern is ensuring AI serves human flourishing rather than replacing human decision-making in critical areas or concentrating power. This aligns with his broader <a href="../vatican-resources/lvii-world-day-of-peace-2024-artificial-intelligence-and-peace.html">teaching on AI and peace</a>.</p>

Leaders must establish regulatory frameworks ensuring AI respects human rights, serves the common good, and does not threaten democratic institutions. The pope called for international treaties on AI, particularly regarding autonomous weapons, and emphasized that democratic societies must maintain public oversight of technologies that fundamentally affect human life.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Francis reiterated in <a href="../vatican-resources/participation-of-the-holy-father-francis-at-the-g7-in-borgo-egnazia-puglia-14-june-2024.html">his G7 address</a> the Vatican's absolute opposition to lethal autonomous weapons systems, stating that no machine should ever choose to take a human life. This directly engaged ongoing United Nations discussions about autonomous weapons regulation. The pope's message to G7 leaders was a call for these powerful nations to lead international efforts toward a treaty banning LAWS, building on the Vatican's consistent <a href="../vatican-resources/archbishop-gallagher-delivers-statement-at-the-united-nations-security-council-open-debate-on-artifi.html">statements at the UN</a>.</p>

Pope Francis called for multilateral cooperation, sharing of AI benefits with developing nations, and global standards ensuring AI development worldwide respects human dignity. He warned against an AI divide where wealthy nations benefit while poorer nations face only the risks of AI, emphasizing that technology must serve global solidarity and the common good of all humanity.</p>
