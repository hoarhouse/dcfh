            <h2>Understanding Intelligence vs Wisdom</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the difference between knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">Dicastery for Culture and Education document on AI and Wisdom</a> distinguishes three levels: <strong>Knowledge</strong> is the accumulation of information and facts. <strong>Intelligence</strong> is the ability to process information, solve problems, and adapt to new situations. <strong>Wisdom</strong> transcends both—it is the capacity to apply knowledge and intelligence with prudence, moral judgment, and understanding of deeper human values and ultimate meaning. AI excels at knowledge storage and certain forms of intelligence, but wisdom requires lived experience, moral reasoning, empathy, and understanding that remain distinctively human.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can artificial intelligence be wise?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. According to <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">the Vatican document</a>, while AI can process vast amounts of information and simulate decision-making patterns, it lacks the essential elements of wisdom: consciousness, moral agency, experiential understanding, and the ability to grasp ultimate meaning and purpose. Wisdom involves integration of knowledge with virtue, lived experience, and understanding of the human condition—dimensions that AI systems fundamentally lack. AI can be a tool for wise people, but cannot itself possess wisdom.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Wisdom is not merely accumulated knowledge, but the ability to judge rightly about the ultimate ends of human life."

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does wisdom require that AI cannot provide?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">document</a> identifies several capacities beyond AI's reach: (1) <strong>Existential understanding</strong>—grasping questions of meaning, purpose, and ultimate value, (2) <strong>Moral agency</strong>—taking responsibility for choices with ethical weight, (3) <strong>Empathy and compassion</strong>—understanding others' experiences from within, (4) <strong>Holistic judgment</strong>—integrating multiple dimensions of human experience, (5) <strong>Self-awareness</strong>—understanding one's own limitations and biases, and (6) <strong>Lived experience</strong>—learning through personal encounter with reality and suffering.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI affect human learning and education?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">the Dicastery document</a>, AI presents both opportunities and challenges for education. <strong>Opportunities include:</strong> personalized learning experiences adapted to individual needs, access to vast educational resources, tools for teachers to better understand student progress, and new forms of interactive learning. <strong>Challenges include:</strong> risk of reducing education to mere information transfer, potential erosion of critical thinking skills, loss of human relationships essential to learning, and narrowing of education to easily measurable outcomes while neglecting formation of character and wisdom.</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real-World Challenge: AI Tutoring Systems</h3>
                    <p><strong>Situation:</strong> AI tutoring systems can provide personalized instruction at scale, adapting to each student's pace and learning style.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vatican Wisdom:</strong> The document reminds us that true education involves more than content delivery—it requires human mentorship, moral formation, inspiration, and the cultivation of wisdom that can only occur through authentic human relationships.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI challenge traditional concepts of education?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">Vatican teaching</a> explains that AI challenges education to distinguish between its essential and non-essential elements. True education is not merely information transfer but formation of the whole person—intellectual, moral, social, and spiritual. The presence of AI highlights the irreplaceable value of human relationships in education: the mentorship, inspiration, moral formation, and wisdom that can only be transmitted through human interaction and example. AI can deliver content, but cannot form persons or cultivate wisdom.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How should educational institutions respond to AI?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">the document</a>, educational institutions should: (1) use AI as a tool while preserving human-centered learning, (2) emphasize capabilities AI cannot replicate—creativity, moral reasoning, wisdom, (3) teach critical evaluation of AI outputs and limitations, (4) maintain the centrality of human relationships in education, (5) focus on formation of character, not just skills transmission, and (6) cultivate humanistic education alongside technical training. Education must prepare students not just to use AI, but to guide it wisely.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the danger of confusing AI intelligence with human wisdom?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">Vatican document</a> warns that confusing AI intelligence with wisdom risks: (1) delegating moral decisions to systems incapable of moral reasoning, (2) erosion of human responsibility and agency, (3) reducing complex human questions to technical problems, (4) loss of appreciation for dimensions of life AI cannot measure, and (5) creating dependence on systems that cannot understand authentic human flourishing. This confusion threatens to undermine the very wisdom needed to use AI well.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Key Distinction:</strong> AI can process information and recognize patterns; wisdom integrates knowledge with virtue, experience, and understanding of ultimate meaning.

            <h2>Wisdom Guiding Technology</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What role should wisdom play in AI development?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">the teaching</a>, human wisdom must guide every stage of AI development—from initial design decisions to deployment and governance. This requires: (1) asking fundamental questions about purpose and human flourishing, (2) incorporating ethical reflection throughout the development process, (3) including diverse perspectives, especially from humanities and ethics, (4) considering long-term consequences for human dignity and society, and (5) maintaining human responsibility and accountability. Technical capability alone, without wisdom, can produce systems that harm human flourishing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the relationship between wisdom and technology?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">document</a> explains that technology extends human capabilities but cannot replace wisdom. Throughout history, technology has been a tool for human purposes—wisdom determines whether those purposes serve authentic human flourishing. The relationship should be hierarchical: wisdom guides technology, not vice versa. When technology drives human decisions without wisdom's guidance, it risks reducing humans to mere functions or data points, serving efficiency rather than human dignity and the common good.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What future relationship between AI and human wisdom should we seek?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">Vatican vision</a> maintains a clear hierarchy: human wisdom guides AI development and deployment. This means: (1) AI serves human purposes defined by wisdom, (2) critical decisions remain under human judgment and responsibility, (3) technology enhances rather than replaces human capacities for wisdom, (4) education cultivates wisdom alongside technical competence, and (5) society values and cultivates wisdom as essential for navigating technological change. The goal is AI as a tool serving wise purposes, not AI replacing human wisdom.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Technology must serve wisdom, not replace it. The greatest danger is not that machines become too intelligent, but that humans become less wise."

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How can we cultivate wisdom in a technological age?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">document</a> emphasizes that cultivating wisdom requires: (1) maintaining spaces for contemplation and reflection, (2) engaging with classical sources of wisdom—philosophy, theology, literature, (3) practicing discernment in technology use, (4) forming authentic human relationships, (5) developing moral character alongside technical skills, (6) asking ultimate questions about meaning and purpose, and (7) learning from lived experience and from the wisdom of elders and traditions. Wisdom grows through practice, not just information acquisition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How can religious and philosophical traditions contribute to AI wisdom?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">According to <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">the Vatican teaching</a>, religious and philosophical traditions offer: (1) centuries of reflection on human nature, purpose, and flourishing, (2) frameworks for moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, (3) understanding of transcendent dimensions of human experience, (4) wisdom about technology's proper relationship to human life, and (5) vision of authentic human development beyond mere material or technical progress. These traditions provide resources for the wisdom needed to guide AI toward serving human dignity and the common good.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What practical steps can individuals take?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Individuals can implement <a href="../vatican-resources/artificial-intelligence-and-wisdom.html">this teaching</a> by: (1) pursuing education that integrates technical knowledge with humanities and ethics, (2) regularly practicing contemplation and reflection apart from screens, (3) reading classical literature and philosophy alongside technical materials, (4) cultivating real-world relationships and experiences, (5) asking "why" and "should we" questions alongside "how" questions about technology, (6) learning from mentors and wisdom traditions, and (7) practicing discernment about technology's proper role in life. Wisdom develops through intentional cultivation, not passive consumption of information.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Practical Wisdom Development:</strong> Regular contemplation, engagement with wisdom traditions, authentic relationships, moral formation, and asking ultimate questions about meaning and purpose.
