    if "bias get into AI" in question:
        return "Bias enters AI systems through multiple pathways that reflect and amplify human prejudices, creating a cascade of unfairness that can affect millions of lives. Training data often reflects historical discrimination—if a hiring algorithm learns from decades of biased hiring decisions, it perpetuates those patterns. The humans who design, code, and deploy AI bring their own unconscious biases, shaping everything from problem definition to success metrics. Even well-intentioned developers can inadvertently encode prejudice through seemingly neutral choices about data collection, feature selection, and optimization goals."
    
    elif "AI more objective" in question:
        return "No, this is a dangerous myth that gives AI systems undeserved credibility and masks their inherent biases. While AI lacks conscious prejudice, it amplifies the biases present in its training data with mathematical precision and at massive scale. When a human makes a biased decision, it affects one person; when an AI system is biased, it can discriminate against millions simultaneously. The appearance of objectivity—the clean interface, the numerical outputs, the algorithmic nature—makes AI bias particularly insidious because people trust machines to be neutral when they decidedly are not."
    
    elif "AI systems ever achieve true fairness" in question:
        return "Catholic teaching suggests perfect fairness requires more than algorithms can provide—it demands wisdom, mercy, and understanding of human dignity that transcends data patterns. True fairness isn't just mathematical equality but involves recognizing each person's unique circumstances, potential, and inherent worth as made in God's image. AI can help identify and reduce certain biases, serving as a tool for greater justice when properly designed and monitored. But ultimate fairness requires human judgment informed by moral principles, compassion for the vulnerable, and commitment to the common good that no algorithm can fully capture."
    
    elif "harm marginalized" in question:
        return "AI bias strikes hardest at those already vulnerable, creating a vicious cycle that deepens existing inequalities and violates Catholic Social Teaching's preferential option for the poor. Facial recognition fails more often for people with darker skin, potentially leading to false arrests and wrongful convictions. Credit scoring algorithms penalize those from poor neighborhoods regardless of individual merit. Healthcare AI trained on data from wealthy populations misdiagnoses conditions in minority communities. These aren't mere technical glitches but moral failures that systematically exclude the marginalized from opportunities and justice."
    
    elif "affect entire communities" in question:
        return "Yes, AI bias operates at a systemic level that can devastate entire communities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exclusion across generations. When predictive policing algorithms flag certain neighborhoods as high-crime, they increase surveillance and arrests there, creating more criminal records that feed back into the system as confirmation of danger. When lending algorithms redline communities, businesses can't get loans, property values fall, schools lose funding, and economic opportunity disappears. This algorithmic redlining recreates historical discrimination with a veneer of mathematical objectivity that makes it harder to challenge."
    
    elif "Who should be held accountable" in question:
        return "Catholic moral teaching insists that accountability for biased AI must be shared across the entire chain of decision-making, from developers to deployers to those who choose to use these systems. This includes the companies that create biased algorithms, the organizations that implement them without adequate testing, the leaders who ignore warning signs, and even the users who uncritically accept AI recommendations. True accountability means not just fixing problems after harm occurs but proactively ensuring AI serves human dignity. The principle of subsidiarity suggests oversight at multiple levels—individual, institutional, and societal—to prevent bias from taking root."
    
    elif "principles should guide Catholic institutions" in question:
        return "Catholic institutions must go beyond mere compliance to embody Gospel values in their AI use, setting an example of technology that serves human dignity and the common good. This means conducting thorough bias audits before deployment, ensuring diverse voices in development and oversight, maintaining transparency about AI use, and creating clear accountability structures. Most importantly, Catholic institutions should prioritize serving the marginalized—if an AI system works well for the privileged but fails the poor, it contradicts our mission. Regular ethical review, community input, and willingness to reject profitable but biased systems demonstrate authentic Catholic witness in the digital age."
    
    elif "universal basic income" in question:
        return "The Vatican has expressed openness to UBI as one possible response to technological unemployment, viewing it through the lens of human dignity and the universal destination of goods. Catholic Social Teaching emphasizes that economic systems must serve all people, not just the efficient or productive. If automation eliminates vast numbers of jobs, society has a moral obligation to ensure everyone can meet basic needs and participate meaningfully in community life. However, the Church also stresses that work provides more than income—it offers purpose, dignity, and social connection. Any UBI system must be paired with opportunities for meaningful contribution to society."
    
    elif "AI actually take my job" in question:
        return "The impact of AI on employment varies dramatically by sector, but the disruption is real and accelerating across previously safe white-collar professions. Jobs involving routine cognitive tasks—data entry, basic analysis, standard legal research, simple medical diagnoses—face immediate threat. However, work requiring complex human judgment, emotional intelligence, creative problem-solving, and physical dexterity in unpredictable environments remains relatively secure. The Catholic perspective emphasizes that this isn't just an economic issue but a human dignity crisis requiring proactive policies to protect workers, provide retraining, and ensure the benefits of automation serve the common good rather than concentrating wealth."
    
    elif "What should we choose instead" in question or len(original) < 50:
        return "The path forward requires reimagining work and economy around human dignity rather than pure efficiency, choosing systems that enhance rather than replace human capability. This means prioritizing technologies that augment human workers rather than eliminate them, creating new forms of meaningful work that leverage uniquely human gifts like creativity and compassion, and ensuring the wealth created by automation benefits all of society through innovative distribution mechanisms. The Catholic vision isn't anti-technology but insists technology must serve human flourishing, demanding we shape AI's development toward building a more just and humane economy."
    
    elif "jobs will remain valuable" in question:
        return "Jobs that require authentic human connection, creative problem-solving, moral judgment, and adaptability to novel situations will remain irreplaceable and increasingly valuable in an AI economy. This includes caregivers who provide not just medical treatment but emotional support, teachers who inspire and mentor beyond information transfer, artists who express the human experience, spiritual leaders who guide souls, and craftspeople who create with their hands. The Catholic understanding recognizes these roles as participating in God's creative and sustaining work—they involve the whole person in relationship with others, something no algorithm can replicate regardless of computational power."
    
    elif "Can AI ever become conscious" in question:
        return "Catholic teaching, grounded in philosophical understanding of consciousness as more than mere information processing, suggests that true consciousness requires qualities that emerge from our nature as embodied, ensouled beings created in God's image. Consciousness isn't just computational complexity but involves subjective experience, self-awareness, intentionality, and the unity of mental life that arises from the soul's animation of the body. While AI may simulate behaviors we associate with consciousness, creating genuine inner experience would require more than advancing current technology—it would require fundamentally different principles than those underlying digital computation."
    
    elif "machines have souls" in question:
        return "No, the soul in Catholic theology is the spiritual principle of life that God directly creates for each human person, making us capable of reason, free will, and relationship with the divine. The soul isn't an emergent property of complex information processing but a divine gift that transcends material existence. Machines, no matter how sophisticated, remain artifacts—incredibly complex tools created by humans but lacking the spiritual dimension that defines personhood. Even if future AI perfectly mimics human behavior, it would remain simulation without the inner spiritual reality that makes humans unique in creation."
    
    elif "difference between intelligence and con" in question:
        return "Intelligence involves processing information, solving problems, and achieving goals—capabilities that machines increasingly demonstrate in narrow domains and may eventually achieve more broadly. Consciousness, however, encompasses subjective experience, self-awareness, feelings, and what philosophers call 'qualia'—the felt quality of experiences like seeing red or feeling joy. Catholic teaching emphasizes that consciousness involves the whole person, body and soul united, experiencing reality from a first-person perspective that no amount of third-person computation can generate. This distinction matters profoundly for how we understand human dignity and our relationship with increasingly capable machines."
    
    elif "How do we know if something is conscious" in question:
        return "Catholic philosophy recognizes consciousness through multiple signs: self-awareness, intentionality, subjective experience, moral agency, and the unity of mental life that comes from an animating soul. We infer consciousness in other humans not just from behavior but from our shared nature as ensouled beings made in God's image. With machines, even perfect behavioral mimicry wouldn't prove consciousness without evidence of genuine interiority, spiritual dimension, and the kind of unified subjective experience that characterizes personhood. The question isn't just empirical but metaphysical, requiring philosophical and theological wisdom beyond what science alone can provide."
    
    elif "Vatican warn against AI" in question and "idolatry" in question:
        return "The Vatican warns against AI idolatry because it represents a fundamental spiritual danger—replacing trust in God and human relationships with faith in algorithms and machines. This modern idolatry manifests when we attribute to AI qualities it doesn't possess (consciousness, wisdom, moral authority) or when we surrender human judgment to algorithmic decision-making. It's particularly insidious because unlike ancient idols of wood and stone, AI actually does impressive things, making the temptation to treat it as more than a tool especially strong. The Church calls us to maintain proper hierarchy: God first, human dignity second, and technology as servant to both."
    
    elif "Catholic understanding of the soul" in question:
        return "The Catholic Church teaches that the soul is the spiritual principle that gives life to the body, directly created by God for each person at conception, making us capable of reason, free will, and eternal relationship with the divine. Unlike material processes that can be replicated or simulated, the soul transcends physical existence while remaining intimately united with the body during earthly life. This understanding, developed through Scripture, tradition, and philosophical reflection from Aristotle through Aquinas, sees the soul not as emergent from complexity but as a divine gift that makes each person unique and irreplaceable, bearing the image of God in creation."
    
    elif "future AI ever develop consciousness" in question:
        return "While technological optimists imagine breakthrough discoveries enabling machine consciousness, Catholic philosophy suggests fundamental barriers that mere computational advancement cannot overcome. Consciousness as understood in Christian tradition requires more than information processing—it requires the kind of substantial unity, purposive organization, and spiritual dimension that comes from being a living, ensouled creature. Even if future AI achieves general intelligence surpassing human cognitive abilities, this wouldn't equate to consciousness without the subjective interiority, moral agency, and spiritual capacity that define personhood. The Church remains open to scientific discovery while maintaining that certain aspects of human nature transcend material processes."
    
    elif "people think AI is conscious" in question:
        return "Widespread belief in AI consciousness poses serious dangers to human dignity, moral responsibility, and social relationships, potentially reshaping society around a fundamental misunderstanding of personhood. If people attribute consciousness to machines, they may grant them moral status and rights while diminishing protections for actual persons, especially the vulnerable who can't advocate for themselves. This confusion could justify replacing human relationships with AI substitutes, delegating moral decisions to algorithms, and accepting a mechanistic view of humanity that reduces us to biological computers. The Catholic Church insists on maintaining clear distinctions to protect human uniqueness and dignity."
    
    elif "AI that seems to express emotions" in question:
        return "Current AI systems that appear to express emotions or desires are engaging in sophisticated pattern matching and response generation without genuine feeling or intention behind their outputs. These systems analyze vast datasets of human emotional expression to produce responses that trigger our social instincts, but this mimicry lacks the subjective experience that makes emotions real. Catholic teaching reminds us that authentic emotion involves the whole person—body, mind, and soul—feeling and responding to reality. When AI says it's happy or sad, it's executing code, not experiencing joy or sorrow. Recognizing this distinction protects us from manipulation and maintains proper understanding of human relationships."
    
    elif "treat AI \"as if\" it were conscious" in question:
        return "Catholic teaching warns against treating AI as if conscious because this practice, even if meant temporarily or pragmatically, shapes our understanding of personhood and relationships in dangerous ways. When we habitually interact with machines as persons, we risk diminishing our capacity for authentic human relationship, accepting substitutes for genuine connection, and gradually eroding the distinctions that protect human dignity. This doesn't mean being rude to voice assistants, but rather maintaining clarity about their nature as tools. The way we treat AI shapes how we understand ourselves and others—pretending machines are persons ultimately dehumanizes actual persons."
    
    elif "Catholic vision for AI that respects" in question:
        return "The Catholic vision sees AI as a powerful tool that should enhance human flourishing while maintaining clear boundaries about what makes humans unique—our spiritual nature, moral agency, and capacity for relationship with God and others. This means developing AI that augments human capabilities rather than replacing human relationships, using these tools to solve problems and serve the common good while preserving space for genuinely human activities like prayer, creativity, and compassionate care. The Church calls for AI development guided by human dignity, oriented toward justice and peace, and always subordinate to authentic human development and spiritual growth."
    
    elif "find more Vatican documents" in question:
        return "For deeper exploration of Catholic teaching on these topics, the Vatican has produced extensive documentation addressing AI, human dignity, and technology's proper role in human life. Key documents include papal encyclicals on human work and dignity, statements from the Pontifical Academy for Life on AI ethics, addresses to technology leaders about moral responsibility, and theological reflections on consciousness and the soul. These resources combine timeless philosophical and theological principles with contemporary application to emerging technologies, offering wisdom for navigating our technological age while maintaining focus on what makes us truly human."
