According to Pope John Paul II's 1981 encyclical Laborem Exercens, work is "participation in creation itself <a href="../vatican-resources/lvii-world-day-of-peace-2024-artificial-intelligence-and-peace.html">Read Pope Francis on AI and human dignity</a>" that allows humans to find purpose and contribute to the common good.</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "Work is for man, not man for work."

                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">Work gives people not just income, but identity, purpose, and community belonging. When automation eliminates jobs without providing alternatives or support for displaced workers, it violates this fundamental dignity. The Vatican teaches that economic decisions are moral decisions, and companies must measure the moral cost of automation alongside economic gains.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What are the three essential principles for AI and work?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic teaching identifies three essential principles that must guide AI's impact on work. First, human dignity must be protected—workers are persons with inherent worth, not mere resources to be optimized for profit. Second, work serves the common good, not just economic efficiency or shareholder returns. Technology should benefit all of society, especially the vulnerable. Third, AI should augment human capabilities rather than simply replace human workers wherever possible. These principles demand that AI implementation consider not just efficiency gains but the full human and social costs of automation, ensuring technology serves justice and human flourishing rather than just maximizing corporate profit.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">While the Vatican has not officially endorsed universal basic income as specific policy, Pope Francis's teaching on automation and work opens the door to such discussions.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">His emphasis on "intergenerational solidarity" and the need for "strong safety nets" when automation displaces workers suggests support for bold economic interventions. The Church's principle that "dignity is not a byproduct of productivity <a href="../blog/domus-communis-foundation/take-action-advance-ethical-ai-and-technology-for-humanity.html">Learn how to advocate for worker dignity</a>" aligns with UBI's premise that human worth exists independent of labor market participation.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">The Catholic response to AI isn't passive resignation—it's active preparation while demanding justice. Workers should develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it: creative problem-solving, ethical reasoning, emotional intelligence, and relationship-building that machines cannot replicate. Stay informed about how AI affects your industry and advocate collectively through unions or professional associations for fair transitions. Build financial resilience and explore portable benefits not tied to specific employers. But crucially, don't accept the narrative that worker displacement is inevitable—demand that companies share automation gains, provide retraining, and that governments create policies ensuring technology serves workers, not just capital.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How should Catholic employers approach AI automation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic employers bear special moral obligations when implementing AI automation. They must measure not just economic gains but the full human cost of workforce changes. This means providing generous advance notice, comprehensive retraining programs, outplacement support, and considering job redesign that preserves employment rather than automatic replacement. Catholic Social Teaching demands that employers share automation productivity gains with workers through wage increases or profit-sharing, not just enriching executives and shareholders. Employers should prioritize augmentation strategies that enhance human workers over pure replacement, maintain meaningful human oversight and decision-making authority, and consider the impact on local communities whose economic health depends on stable employment.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Before deploying AI, employers should:</strong></p>
                <ul class="faq-answer">
                    <li><strong>Put human dignity first</strong> - Ask "How will this affect our workers' wellbeing and sense of purpose?" not just "How will this cut costs?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Involve workers in decisions</strong> - Those who will be affected by AI systems should have a voice in how they're implemented</li>
                    <li><strong>Share productivity gains</strong> - If AI makes your company more efficient, that should benefit workers through higher wages, shorter hours, or better conditions—not just shareholders</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide real retraining</strong> - Don't just lay off displaced workers. Invest in meaningful retraining programs with clear pathways to comparable employment</li>
                    <li><strong>Reject surveillance culture</strong> - Use AI to improve safety and workflows, not to micromanage and dehumanize workers</li>

Essential policies include: requiring advance notice and worker consultation before major automation; mandating that companies share productivity gains through higher wages or reduced hours rather than pure job elimination; investing heavily in education, retraining, and lifelong learning programs; creating portable benefits and strong social safety nets that recognize work's centrality to dignity even when traditional employment is disrupted; strengthening collective bargaining rights so workers have power to negotiate AI implementation; and potentially exploring ideas like robot taxes to fund transition support or universal basic services ensuring everyone can live with dignity.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">We must resist several dangerous narratives that serve to concentrate power and wealth while abandoning workers. First, reject technological determinism—the claim that job displacement is inevitable and we must simply accept it. Technology's impact depends on human choices about how to develop and deploy it. Second, resist the reduction of work to mere economic transaction, ignoring its role in human dignity, community, and meaning. Third, oppose the narrative that displaced workers are personally responsible for their obsolescence through failure to "adapt." Fourth, reject the concentration of automation benefits among capital owners and executives while workers bear all the costs. The Catholic vision insists we can and must shape technology toward justice.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Is there hope? What jobs will remain valuable?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Pope Leo XIV, in his June 2025 message on AI, reminded us that humans possess something AI never can: the ability to ask ultimate questions, to seek meaning and truth, to love and be loved, to make moral choices grounded in conscience.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Hope Grounded in Reality:</strong> The jobs that will remain most valuable in an AI age are precisely those requiring uniquely human capacities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teaching and mentoring</li>
                        <li>Caring for the sick and elderly</li>
                        <li>Creative and artistic expression</li>
                        <li>Ethical leadership and decision-making</li>
                        <li>Building and sustaining communities</li>
                        <li>Spiritual guidance and counseling</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are not jobs that can be automated—they are vocations that reflect the image of God in humanity.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">Will AI replace human jobs? The answer depends on the choices we make today.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">If we allow AI to be deployed solely according to market logic—maximizing profit and efficiency without regard for human dignity—then yes, millions will lose meaningful work, communities will be devastated, and inequality will explode.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">But if we choose to govern AI according to Catholic Social Teaching—prioritizing human dignity, ensuring worker participation, sharing productivity gains, and investing in human flourishing—then AI can become a tool that liberates us from drudgery and creates space for more meaningful, creative, and relationship-centered work.</p>

                    "AI is a product of human genius. How we use it will reveal whether we truly value human dignity or have lost sight of what makes us human."
