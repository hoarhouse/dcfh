            <h2>Understanding AI Deception</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are deepfakes and why do they matter?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Deepfakes are AI-generated images, videos, or audio that convincingly depict people saying or doing things they never actually said or did. The term combines "deep learning" with "fake."</p>
                
                <p class="faq-answer">Examples include video of political leaders making statements they never made, audio of your voice saying things you never said, images of events that never happened, and fabricated evidence of crimes.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">Deepfakes matter because they attack something fundamental: our ability to trust what we see and hear. For all of human history, seeing was believing. AI has shattered that certainty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI enable misinformation differently than traditional lies?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Humans have always been capable of lying. But AI changes three critical factors: scale, speed, and sophistication.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Scale:</strong> AI can generate thousands of fake articles, images, or videos in minutes and spread them across millions of accounts simultaneously.
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Speed:</strong> A fake video can go viral and influence an election before fact-checkers identify it as false.
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Sophistication:</strong> Modern deepfakes are often indistinguishable from reality, even to trained observers.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is "AI hallucination" and why is it dangerous?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">AI "hallucination" occurs when AI systems generate information that sounds plausible but is completely falseâ€”not intentionally, but because of how they're designed.</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real Example: AI Inventing Legal Cases</h3>
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In 2023, a lawyer used ChatGPT to research legal precedents. The AI generated convincing citations with proper formatting, judge names, and case numbers.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> None of the cases existed. ChatGPT had hallucinated entirely fictional legal precedents.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> The lawyer faced sanctions, demonstrating how AI can fabricate "facts" that people trust.</p>

            <h2>Catholic Teaching on Truth</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does the Eighth Commandment say about AI deception?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Eighth Commandmentâ€”"You shall not bear false witness"â€”directly addresses deception. Creating or spreading deepfakes violates this commandment in the digital age.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">The moral principle remains the same: intentionally deceiving others about reality is gravely wrong. Using digital tools doesn't change the moral nature of the act.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why does Catholic teaching emphasize truth so strongly?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic theology grounds truth in the very nature of God. Jesus declared "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).</p>

                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "God cannot lie (Titus 1:2). When we commit to truth, we participate in God's character."
                    <cite>â€” Catholic Catechism</cite>
                </div>

                <p class="faq-answer">Truth matters because it reflects God's nature, respects human dignity, enables community, and connects us to reality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Is creating deepfakes always wrong, or are there legitimate uses?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholic moral theology distinguishes between deceptive and non-deceptive uses of synthetic media.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Legitimate Uses (When Clearly Labeled):</strong> Entertainment CGI, historical reconstruction, accessibility tools, educational demonstrations.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Always Wrong:</strong> Creating deepfakes intended to deceive, fabricating evidence, non-consensual synthetic media, manipulating elections.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How are deepfakes being used to harm real people?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican warns that "while the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the damage they cause is real."</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>Real Harms from Deepfakes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Political Manipulation:</strong> Fake videos can sway elections before they're debunked.</p>
                    <p><strong>Financial Fraud:</strong> In 2019, a UK company lost $243,000 to a deepfake voice scam.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personal Destruction:</strong> Deepfake pornography weaponizes intimate imagery.</p>
                    <p><strong>Religious Authority Theft:</strong> Deepfakes of Pope Francis making false statements mislead millions.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What about AI misinformation in elections?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Elections are particularly vulnerable because timing matters. A false story released days before voting can influence outcomes before it's debunked.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">AI enables election manipulation through fake candidate content, synthetic evidence, micro-targeted lies, and flooding fact-checkers with so much false content that truth can't keep up.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does AI-generated misinformation threaten social trust?</h3>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>The Cascading Crisis of Trust</h3>
                    <p><strong>Stage 1 - Uncertainty:</strong> People can't distinguish real from fake.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 2 - Suspicion:</strong> People begin doubting everything.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 3 - Polarization:</strong> Without shared facts, people retreat into echo chambers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 4 - Social Collapse:</strong> Cooperation becomes impossible when no one agrees on reality.</p>
