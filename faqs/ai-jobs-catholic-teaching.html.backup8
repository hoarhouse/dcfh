            <p class="faq-subtitle">Catholic Teaching on Work, Technology, and Human Dignity</p>
        </div>

        <article class="faq-content">
            <h2>The Question That Keeps Workers Up at Night</h2>
            <p>From factory floors to corporate offices, from hospitals to legal firms, millions of workers worldwide are asking the same question: "Will artificial intelligence take my job?"</p>
            
            <p>It's not paranoia—it's reality. AI systems are already diagnosing diseases, writing legal briefs, designing products, managing logistics, and even creating art. As these technologies advance at breakneck speed, the question isn't <em>if</em> AI will transform work, but <em>how we ensure this transformation serves human dignity rather than undermining it</em>.</p>
            
            <p>The Catholic Church, drawing on centuries of reflection about work, technology, and human flourishing, offers a uniquely hopeful yet clear-eyed perspective on this challenge.</p>

            <h2>What the Vatican Says: Recent Teachings on AI and Work</h2>
            <p>In January 2025, the Vatican released "Antiqua et Nova," a comprehensive document addressing the relationship between artificial intelligence and human intelligence. This landmark teaching dedicates substantial attention to work and employment, offering guidance rooted in Catholic Social Teaching.</p>

            <h3>The Core Concern: Human Dignity in the Workplace</h3>
            <p>The document warns that while AI promises increased productivity, current approaches to the technology can paradoxically deskill workers, subject them to automated surveillance, and relegate them to rigid and repetitive tasks.</p>

            <p>This isn't theoretical. Consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warehouse workers</strong> tracked by AI systems measuring their movements down to the second</li>
                <li><strong>Customer service representatives</strong> reading scripts generated by AI, becoming mere voices for machines</li>
                <li><strong>Radiologists</strong> whose years of training are being supplanted by image-recognition algorithms</li>
                <li><strong>Writers and artists</strong> watching AI systems generate in seconds what took them years to master</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Work Is More Than Economics</h3>
            <p>Pope Francis has consistently emphasized that work isn't merely a means of earning income—it's participation in God's creative activity, essential to human dignity and integral development.</p>

            <p>When AI reduces workers to cogs in an automated system, or when it eliminates jobs without providing pathways to meaningful alternative work, it violates this fundamental dignity.</p>

            <h2>The Catholic Framework: Three Essential Principles</h2>

            <h3>1. Work Is a Gift and a Right</h3>
            <p>Catholic Social Teaching affirms that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every person has a right to productive work</li>
                <li>Work allows humans to participate in God's ongoing creation</li>
                <li>Through work, people develop their talents and serve the common good</li>
                <li>Labor has priority over capital—workers are not mere "resources" to be optimized</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>What this means for AI</h4>
                <p>Technology should enhance workers' abilities, not replace their dignity. AI systems must be designed with worker wellbeing as the primary goal, not just efficiency or profit maximization.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Technology Must Serve Humanity, Not Vice Versa</h3>
            <p>From "Antiqua et Nova": Technology is a tool created by human intelligence. Like all human creations, it can be directed toward positive or negative ends. The choice belongs to us.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>What this means for AI</h4>
                <p>We're not helpless victims of technological change. Society has the power—and the responsibility—to shape how AI is developed and deployed. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regulations that protect workers from exploitative surveillance</li>
                    <li>Investment in education and retraining programs</li>
                    <li>Business models that prioritize human flourishing alongside productivity</li>
                    <li>Democratic participation in decisions about AI deployment</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Solidarity with Those Most Affected</h3>
            <p>Catholic Social Teaching emphasizes preferential option for the poor and vulnerable. In the AI revolution, this means special attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Workers in routine jobs most susceptible to automation</li>
                <li>Communities dependent on industries facing disruption</li>
                <li>People without access to retraining or education</li>
                <li>Older workers who face discrimination in the job market</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>What this means for AI</h4>
                <p>Decisions about AI adoption cannot be left solely to corporate executives or technologists. Workers, unions, community organizations, and those likely to be displaced must have a voice in how these technologies are implemented.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Will AI Actually Take Your Job? The Nuanced Answer</h2>

            <h3>Jobs That Are Changing (Not Disappearing)</h3>
            <p>Most experts agree that AI won't eliminate work entirely, but it will transform it dramatically. The Vatican document encourages us to ask better questions than "will AI take jobs?" Instead:</p>

            <h4>Better Question #1: What kind of work will remain meaningful and available?</h4>
            <p>Jobs requiring uniquely human capacities are harder to automate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empathy and emotional intelligence</strong> (counseling, nursing, teaching)</li>
                <li><strong>Complex problem-solving in novel situations</strong> (emergency response, leadership)</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity and ethical judgment</strong> (art, ethics consultation, strategic planning)</li>
                <li><strong>Interpersonal trust and relationship-building</strong> (ministry, social work, diplomacy)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Better Question #2: Who benefits from AI-driven productivity gains?</h4>
            <p>If AI makes a company 50% more productive, does that translate to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shorter work weeks for employees with the same pay?</li>
                <li>Higher wages for remaining workers?</li>
                <li>Lower prices for consumers?</li>
                <li>Or just higher profits for shareholders while workers are laid off?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Catholic answer is clear: productivity gains should be shared equitably, prioritizing workers and the common good.</p>

            <h4>Better Question #3: How do we ensure access to new opportunities?</h4>
            <p>AI will create new types of work—but will those opportunities be accessible to truck drivers, cashiers, and factory workers whose jobs are automated? Or only to people with advanced technical degrees?</p>
            <p>Catholic teaching demands investment in accessible retraining, education, and support systems.</p>

            <h2>Real-World Examples: AI and Work Today</h2>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study 1: Healthcare - AI as Partner, Not Replacement</h4>
                <p><strong>The Technology:</strong> AI systems can analyze medical images, predict patient deterioration, and suggest treatment protocols with remarkable accuracy.</p>
                <p><strong>The Catholic Perspective:</strong> These tools should augment healthcare workers, not replace them. An AI can spot a tumor on an X-ray, but it cannot:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deliver difficult news with compassion</li>
                    <li>Understand a patient's values and life goals</li>
                    <li>Make ethical judgments about end-of-life care</li>
                    <li>Build trust with a frightened patient</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Hospitals that use AI to handle routine analysis free doctors and nurses to spend more time on the irreplaceably human aspects of care—listening, comforting, explaining, and healing relationships.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study 2: Manufacturing - The Surveillance Problem</h4>
                <p><strong>The Technology:</strong> AI systems track worker productivity, movements, and even predict who might organize a union or take sick leave.</p>
                <p><strong>The Catholic Perspective:</strong> This represents a grave violation of human dignity. Workers are not machines to be optimized. Constant surveillance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treats people as means rather than ends</li>
                    <li>Erodes trust and workplace community</li>
                    <li>Increases stress and health problems</li>
                    <li>Violates privacy and autonomy</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Better Approach:</strong> Use AI to improve workplace safety, identify ergonomic risks, and optimize workflows—with full transparency and worker input.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study 3: Creative Work - Questions of Authorship and Value</h4>
                <p><strong>The Technology:</strong> AI can generate text, images, music, and video in seconds, trained on the work of millions of human creators.</p>
                <p><strong>The Catholic Perspective:</strong> Human creativity reflects the image of God. AI-generated content raises profound questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who owns work created by AI trained on copyrighted material?</li>
                    <li>What happens to artists when AI can produce "good enough" content cheaply?</li>
                    <li>Does AI-generated art have the same value as human creation?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Ethical Path Forward:</strong> Respect the rights of human creators, ensure fair compensation for training data, and maintain space for human artistry that cannot be replicated by algorithms.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What Can Be Done? Practical Steps Forward</h2>

            <h3>For Workers and Individuals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Invest in uniquely human skills:</strong> Emotional intelligence, ethical reasoning, creativity, and complex problem-solving are your competitive advantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay informed and engaged:</strong> Understand how AI might affect your industry. Join professional associations working on AI policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Advocate for protections:</strong> Support unions, worker cooperatives, and policies that ensure AI serves workers rather than exploiting them.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace lifelong learning:</strong> Be open to retraining and new opportunities, but demand that these opportunities be accessible and fairly compensated.</li>
            </ol>

                <li><strong>Put human dignity first:</strong> Before deploying AI, ask "How will this affect our workers' wellbeing and sense of purpose?" not just "How will this cut costs?"</li>
                <li><strong>Involve workers in decisions:</strong> Those who will be affected by AI systems should have a voice in how they're implemented.</li>
                <li><strong>Share productivity gains:</strong> If AI makes your company more efficient, that should benefit workers through higher wages, shorter hours, or better conditions—not just shareholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide real retraining:</strong> Don't just lay off displaced workers. Invest in meaningful retraining programs with clear pathways to comparable employment.</li>
                <li><strong>Reject surveillance culture:</strong> Use AI to improve safety and workflows, not to micromanage and dehumanize workers.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>For Policymakers and Society</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthen worker protections:</strong> Update labor laws for the AI age, including rights to know when AI is being used, contest AI-driven decisions, organize without AI-powered union-busting, and privacy protections against workplace surveillance.</li>
                <li><strong>Invest in education and retraining:</strong> Make accessible, high-quality training programs available to all workers, not just those who can afford elite universities.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore new social models:</strong> Consider policies like universal basic income, guaranteed employment, reduced work weeks with maintained pay, worker ownership models, and taxes on AI productivity gains to fund transition support.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure democratic governance:</strong> Don't let AI development be driven solely by tech companies. Create multi-stakeholder forums including workers, ethicists, and affected communities.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Catholic Vision: Technology in Service of Human Flourishing</h2>
            <p>The Church's response to AI and work isn't Luddite rejection or naive enthusiasm—it's a call to intentional choice guided by human dignity.</p>

            <h3>What We Must Resist</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological determinism:</strong> The false belief that we're powerless to shape technological change</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency worship:</strong> Treating productivity as the highest good, regardless of impact on human wellbeing</li>
                <li><strong>Throwaway culture:</strong> Discarding workers when they're no longer needed, rather than investing in their development</li>
                <li><strong>Dehumanization:</strong> Reducing workers to data points, "human resources," or factors to be optimized</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What We Must Choose</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human dignity as the measure:</strong> Every decision about AI deployment should prioritize the wellbeing and flourishing of workers</li>
                <li><strong>Solidarity over individualism:</strong> Collective action and shared responsibility for those displaced by technological change</li>
                <li><strong>Subsidiarity:</strong> Decisions about AI should involve those most affected, not just executives and engineers</li>
                <li><strong>The common good:</strong> Ensuring AI benefits society broadly, not just wealthy shareholders</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hope Grounded in Reality</h3>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV, in his June 2025 message on AI, reminded us that humans possess something AI never can: the ability to ask ultimate questions, to seek meaning and truth, to love and be loved, to make moral choices grounded in conscience.</p>

            <p>This isn't just philosophical—it's practical. The jobs that will remain most valuable in an AI age are precisely those requiring these uniquely human capacities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaching and mentoring</li>
                <li>Caring for the sick and elderly</li>
                <li>Creative and artistic expression</li>
                <li>Ethical leadership and decision-making</li>
                <li>Building and sustaining communities</li>
                <li>Spiritual guidance and counseling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are not jobs that can be automated—they are vocations that reflect the image of God in humanity.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: A Choice, Not a Destiny</h2>
            <p>Will AI replace human jobs? The answer depends on the choices we make today.</p>

            <p>If we allow AI to be deployed solely according to market logic—maximizing profit and efficiency without regard for human dignity—then yes, millions will lose meaningful work, communities will be devastated, and inequality will explode.</p>

            <p>But if we choose to govern AI according to Catholic Social Teaching—prioritizing human dignity, ensuring worker participation, sharing productivity gains, and investing in human flourishing—then AI can become a tool that liberates us from drudgery and creates space for more meaningful, creative, and relationship-centered work.</p>

            <p>The technology doesn't determine the outcome. We do.</p>

            <p>As "Antiqua et Nova" concludes: AI is a product of human genius. How we use it will reveal whether we truly value human dignity or have lost sight of what makes us human.</p>

                <h3>Discussion Questions for Reflection</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>How has technology already changed work in your industry or community? What has been gained and lost?</li>
                    <li>If AI could handle routine aspects of your job, how would you want to spend the freed-up time? What uniquely human contributions could you make?</li>
                    <li>What responsibilities do employers have to workers displaced by automation? What about society as a whole?</li>
                    <li>How can we ensure that productivity gains from AI benefit workers and communities, not just shareholders?</li>
                    <li>What aspects of your work are irreplaceably human? How can we protect and value these dimensions?</li>
