                    <h3>Real-World Example: IBM Watson for Oncology</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Promise:</strong> IBM's Watson AI was marketed as a revolutionary cancer treatment tool that would analyze patient data and recommend optimal treatments, trained on thousands of medical records and research papers.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Multiple hospitals discontinued Watson after discovering it sometimes recommended unsafe or incorrect treatments. The system reflected biases in its training data and couldn't account for the full complexity of individual patients.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Catholic Lesson:</strong> This demonstrates why human physicians must maintain authority over medical decisions. AI can assist, but the practice of medicine requires human judgment about whole persons, not just data analysis. Patients deserve doctors who take responsibility, not algorithms that can't be held accountable.</p>

                    <h3>Real-World Example: China's Social Credit System</h3>
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> China uses AI to monitor citizens' behavior‚Äîfinancial transactions, social media posts, travel, purchases, even friendships‚Äîand assign scores that determine access to jobs, education, housing, and travel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This system treats human persons as data points to be optimized for state preferences. Low scores restrict fundamental freedoms. The AI enforces ideological conformity and punishes dissent, religious practice, or non-approved behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Catholic Response:</strong> This violates every principle of Catholic Social Teaching‚Äîhuman dignity, freedom, conscience, and the limits of state power. It demonstrates the existential danger when AI is used to create systems of total social control. The Church insists technology must serve persons, never reduce them to profiles or scores.</p>
