                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican distinguishes between defensive systems that protect against incoming missiles (like Iron Dome or Phalanx CIWS) and offensive autonomous weapons that select and engage human targets. Defensive systems that respond to imminent threats where split-second reaction is necessary may be morally permissible if they meet strict criteria: they operate in clearly defined parameters, target only weapons not people, have extensive safety mechanisms, and meaningful human oversight remains possible. However, the Church warns that even defensive systems require careful ethical scrutiny and cannot be allowed to operate as precedent for offensive autonomous weapons targeting humans.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Could AI prevent war crimes by following rules perfectly?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">This argument fundamentally misunderstands both AI capabilities and moral reasoning. First, AI systems cannot "follow rules perfectly"—they make mistakes, exhibit biases from training data, and fail in unexpected ways. Second, the laws of war require contextual judgment that goes beyond rule-following: determining combatant status in ambiguous situations, assessing proportionality when civilian casualties are possible, recognizing when enemies are attempting to surrender, and showing restraint when uncertainty exists. These require human moral faculties—conscience, empathy, practical wisdom—that algorithms cannot replicate. Preventing war crimes requires accountability, and machines cannot be held accountable.</p>

            <h2>Just War Theory & AI</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is Just War Theory?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Just War Theory is a Catholic moral framework developed over centuries for evaluating whether warfare can be morally justified and how it must be conducted. It requires both jus ad bellum (justice in going to war: just cause, right intention, legitimate authority, reasonable chance of success, last resort, proportionality) and jus in bello (justice in conduct: discrimination between combatants and civilians, proportionality in means, treatment of prisoners). The theory recognizes warfare's tragic necessity in some circumstances while insisting it must be constrained by moral principles. The Vatican argues that autonomous weapons violate these principles by removing human moral judgment from combat.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can autonomous weapons satisfy Just War requirements?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No, according to Catholic teaching. Just War Theory requires that those who wage war possess moral virtues including practical wisdom, restraint, and capacity for mercy. Autonomous weapons lack these moral capacities. They cannot assess whether a particular strike serves just cause in complex circumstances. They cannot exercise proportionality by weighing military advantage against civilian harm in nuanced situations. They cannot recognize when an enemy is attempting to surrender or show mercy when appropriate. They cannot distinguish combatants from civilians when status is ambiguous. These moral judgments require human faculties—conscience, empathy, practical reasoning—that AI does not and cannot possess.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What about the principle of discrimination?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Just War principle of discrimination requires distinguishing combatants from civilians and never directly targeting non-combatants. While this sounds like a simple rule AI could follow, in practice it requires complex moral judgment. Is a civilian carrying supplies for soldiers a legitimate target? What about dual-use infrastructure? How do you distinguish a farmer from a militiaman when both carry rifles? These situations require human judgment informed by context, proportionality, and moral reasoning. The Vatican argues that autonomous weapons cannot make these discriminations reliably because they lack human faculties for contextual moral reasoning.</p>
                
                <div class="vatican-quote">
                    "The principle of discrimination between combatants and non-combatants demands human judgment that cannot be reduced to algorithmic decision-making."

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does proportionality apply to AI weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Proportionality in Just War Theory requires that the harm caused by military action not exceed the military advantage gained. This is an inherently human moral judgment—weighing the value of a military objective against the cost in human lives and suffering. How do you program an algorithm to decide whether destroying an enemy position is worth the risk of civilian casualties nearby? What mathematical formula captures the moral weight of these decisions? The Vatican argues this kind of moral calculus cannot be reduced to code. It requires human conscience, practical wisdom, and willingness to bear moral responsibility for tragic choices—capabilities unique to human moral agents.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What would Saint Thomas Aquinas say about autonomous weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">While Aquinas couldn't have imagined AI weapons, his moral framework suggests they would be problematic. Aquinas taught that human beings are made in God's image with rational souls capable of moral deliberation, and that killing in just warfare requires proper authority, right intention, and moral virtue including prudence and temperance. Autonomous weapons lack rational souls, cannot possess moral virtues, cannot deliberate about right intention, and cannot exercise prudential judgment about when force is proportionate. For Aquinas, moral acts require human agency and accountability—conditions impossible to satisfy when machines make kill decisions autonomously.</p>

            <h2>Policy & What Should Happen</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Does the Vatican support a complete ban on autonomous weapons?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. The Holy See has explicitly called for an international treaty banning lethal autonomous weapons systems—similar to treaties banning chemical weapons, biological weapons, and anti-personnel landmines. The Vatican argues that some weapons are inherently immoral regardless of how they're used, and weapons that delegate life-and-death decisions to machines fall into this category. The Church believes meaningful human control must be maintained over all use of lethal force, making fully autonomous weapons morally impermissible regardless of claimed military advantages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What would a ban look like in practice?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">A meaningful ban, as proposed by the Vatican and Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, would prohibit weapons that select and engage targets without meaningful human control. This means requiring human judgment in the targeting loop—a human must make the decision to apply lethal force against a specific target at a specific time. Defensive systems with narrow parameters might be permitted (missile defense systems), but offensive systems that autonomously hunt and kill humans would be banned. The treaty would need verification mechanisms, prohibitions on development and deployment, and clear definitions of "meaningful human control" to be effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why hasn't the international community banned them yet?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Major military powers resist a ban because they see autonomous weapons as strategically advantageous. Countries with advanced AI capabilities—particularly the United States, Russia, China, Israel, and South Korea—are reluctant to forgo weapons they've invested heavily in developing. There's also concern that adversaries might deploy autonomous weapons regardless of bans, creating pressure to develop them for deterrence. Additionally, defining "meaningful human control" and "autonomy" proves technically complex, making treaty negotiations difficult. The Vatican continues pushing for a ban despite these obstacles, arguing moral imperatives outweigh strategic considerations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What role should Catholics play in this debate?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Catholics should advocate loudly for banning lethal autonomous weapons, the Vatican teaches. This means educating ourselves about the technology and moral issues, supporting organizations working for a ban like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, contacting political representatives to demand they support international restrictions, and speaking out when governments or militaries move toward deploying autonomous weapons. Catholic institutions—universities, hospitals, dioceses—should divest from companies developing autonomous weapons. Catholic voters should prioritize this issue when evaluating political candidates. The Church calls this a moral imperative comparable to nuclear disarmament.</p>

                    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
                    <p><strong>Individual Actions:</strong> Sign petitions supporting a ban on lethal autonomous weapons. Contact your elected representatives. Share information about autonomous weapons with your community. Support organizations working for a ban.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Is opposing autonomous weapons futile if adversaries will develop them anyway?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Vatican rejects this deterrence logic. The same argument was made about chemical weapons, biological weapons, and anti-personnel landmines—yet international bans on these weapons exist and are largely respected. Moral arguments helped create these norms. The Church teaches that even if some nations violate a ban, establishing the moral and legal norm that autonomous weapons are unacceptable serves crucial functions: it stigmatizes their use, creates accountability mechanisms, prevents normalization, and provides grounds for prosecution. Additionally, the Vatican argues that fearing what adversaries might do cannot justify abandoning moral principles—we cannot do evil that good may come of it.</p>
