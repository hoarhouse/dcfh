                    <p><strong>The Promise:</strong> Epic Systems deployed an AI algorithm across hundreds of hospitals to predict which patients would develop sepsis, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Investigation revealed the algorithm missed most sepsis cases while generating numerous false alarms, leading to alert fatigue where doctors began ignoring warnings.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Catholic Lesson:</strong> This demonstrates the danger of over-reliance on AI in life-or-death medical decisions. Healthcare AI must be rigorously validated, continuously monitored, and always subject to experienced clinical judgment. Human physicians must maintain ultimate responsibility for patient care.</p>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Clearview AI scraped billions of photos from social media without consent to build a massive facial recognition database sold to law enforcement and private companies.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Ethical Violations:</strong> This violated privacy rights, dignity (reducing persons to biometric data points), and consent. People's faces were harvested and commodified without knowledge or permission.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Catholic Response:</strong> This demonstrates multiple violations of Catholic AI ethics‚Äîlack of informed consent, treating persons as mere data, enabling surveillance that threatens freedom, and prioritizing profit over dignity. Facial recognition requires strict ethical guardrails and must never be deployed without robust protections for privacy and human rights.</p>
