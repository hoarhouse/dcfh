                    <p>Yoshua Bengio, based in Montreal, is a Turing Award–winning computer scientist and one of the three central figures behind the deep learning revolution, alongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. As the scientific director of Mila (Quebec AI Institute), Bengio has built one of the largest and most respected centers for artificial intelligence research in the world. His career has focused on how neural networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.</p><p><br></p><p>Bengio has consistently combined scientific leadership with a sense of ethical responsibility. He was an early signatory of calls for a moratorium on lethal autonomous weapons, and he has pressed governments and corporations to adopt frameworks that place human values at the core of AI development. Unlike some peers who transitioned fully into industry, Bengio has remained deeply connected to academia, training thousands of graduate students and fostering open collaboration across borders.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2018, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun were awarded the Turing Award—sometimes called the “Nobel Prize of computing”—for their foundational contributions to deep learning. The award cemented his place in history as a scientific pioneer. Yet Bengio himself often emphasizes humility, warning that even the researchers who built modern AI do not fully understand the emergent properties of these systems.</p><p>Bengio has also been outspoken about AI’s societal impacts. He highlights risks ranging from misinformation and bias to inequality and unemployment, while advocating for democratic governance of advanced technologies. In 2023, he advised policymakers in Canada and Europe on AI regulation, urging binding laws over voluntary self-regulation. His leadership combines technical brilliance with moral conviction, making him not only a builder of intelligent machines but also a builder of responsible frameworks for their use.</p>
