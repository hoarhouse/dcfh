                    <p>Often referred to as the ‚ÄúGodfather of AI,‚Äù Geoffrey Hinton is one of the most important figures in modern computer science. His pioneering research on neural networks in the 1980s and 1990s laid the groundwork for what we now call deep learning, the engine behind technologies such as voice recognition, image classification, and generative AI models like ChatGPT. Hinton‚Äôs insight was that layered neural architectures could ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from data in ways that mimic how the human brain processes information. For decades, his theories were dismissed as impractical. But by the early 2010s, his ideas began to dominate AI research and industry applications.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2012, Hinton and his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever created a neural network that dramatically outperformed all rivals in the ImageNet competition. That single breakthrough ushered in today‚Äôs AI revolution, changing the course of technology forever. Google quickly acquired Hinton‚Äôs startup, and he became a senior researcher at the company. There, he advanced neural network applications while also mentoring a generation of leading AI scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2023, Hinton made global headlines by resigning from Google to speak more openly about the risks of AI. He warned of the dangers of misinformation, job loss, and even existential threats if superintelligent systems emerge beyond human control. His voice carries unique authority because he not only foresaw the rise of AI but also helped make it possible. Hinton now advocates for international cooperation, stronger guardrails, and a measured pace of development. As a scientist and moral voice, he remains both a builder of the AI age and one of its most cautionary figures.</p><p><br></p><h2>Yoshua Bengio</h2><p>Yoshua Bengio, based in Montreal, is a Turing Award‚Äìwinning computer scientist and one of the three central figures behind the deep learning revolution, alongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. As the scientific director of Mila (Quebec AI Institute), Bengio has built one of the largest and most respected centers for artificial intelligence research in the world. His career has focused on how neural networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning</p><p>.</p><p>Bengio has consistently combined scientific leadership with a sense of ethical responsibility. He was an early signatory of calls for a moratorium on lethal autonomous weapons, and he has pressed governments and corporations to adopt frameworks that place human values at the core of AI development. Unlike some peers who transitioned fully into industry, Bengio has remained deeply connected to academia, training thousands of graduate students and fostering open collaboration across borders.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2018, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun were awarded the Turing Award‚Äîsometimes called the ‚ÄúNobel Prize of computing‚Äù‚Äîfor their foundational contributions to deep learning. The award cemented his place in history as a scientific pioneer. Yet Bengio himself often emphasizes humility, warning that even the researchers who built modern AI do not fully understand the emergent properties of these systems.</p><p>Bengio has also been outspoken about AI‚Äôs societal impacts. He highlights risks ranging from misinformation and bias to inequality and unemployment, while advocating for democratic governance of advanced technologies. In 2023, he advised policymakers in Canada and Europe on AI regulation, urging binding laws over voluntary self-regulation. His leadership combines technical brilliance with moral conviction, making him not only a builder of intelligent machines but also a builder of responsible frameworks for their use.</p>
