            <div class="resource-description">
                <p><strong>Human Intelligence and Society</strong></p><p>Human intelligence, the "core of our development and functioning," remains inseparable from us biologically and spiritually. Our intelligence is not a "product" but resides in our hands and decisions, shaping societies regardless of systems. Many aspects of life have become commodified, but intelligence has so far attempted to resist this.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the creative power of thought we initiate actions, generating data that both reflect and shape our world. Our intelligence is like a seed growing into a tree, evolving with our lives. This individual intelligence is mirrored in the data that is created and observations that arise from us—a "data mirror."</p><p><br></p><p>Yet this mirror is collected, processed, and monetized by third parties. If this data is our "digital soul," then today it is becoming alienated from us and controlled in opaque ways beyond our reach and understanding.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Creation of AI and the Digital Twin</strong></p><p>Artificial intelligence emerges from centralized processes: vast computation meets vast data, producing a mapping of our world, a kind of digital twin. In the future each of us can have a digital twin, which itself will have a digital intelligence. The key question is: whose intelligence is it, and who controls its integrity?</p><p><br></p><p>It must be seen as our own child, derived from our data-body, carrying knowledge shaped by our perspective and our own true experiences and values. Its control and integrity must remain ours. Our digital intelligence must serve our self 100%. We cannot be a product, nor dependent on it. The "freedom to operate" must endure.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, however, this is not so. The technology that creates AI and the data collected about the user are now not under the user's control. There is no guarantee of integrity for created artificial intelligence, nor that combined data from individuals—forming a superintelligence—remains under the control of those who created it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Social Models and Intelligence of Individuals, Freedom to Dream</strong></p><p>Societies are built from individuals. Across millennia, different models emerged, but individual intelligence always remained with the person. Structures varied in how they allowed this to manifest, yet intelligence always arose from humans themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom to dream has always belonged to individuals, never guaranteed by detached technologies. With AI we are able to gain a "digital twin," a stronger extension of ourselves, offering immense new intellectual opportunities. If developed and used rightly, its core will always remain human intelligence—together with morality, faith, values, and ethics—providing its creative force. It should and cannot be severed, manipulated, or controlled from outside.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Universal Foundation Model vs AI Foundation Models – Sovereign AI</strong></p><p>There exists a truly universal "foundation model" which is not a product of Big Tech, but one known to Christians, Hindus, and other faith based theologies. Our intelligence is its instantiation: a "human fine-tuned" version.</p><p><br></p><p>When we create an "AI foundation model," it is simply an aggregation of our intelligence, not a global, transcendent entity. We must not deceive ourselves into thinking we are or can become the Creator.</p><p><br></p><p>We need new technological systems that generate and share intelligence with distributed control and guaranteed integrity of our human intelligence. These must ensure, "by design," that the freedom to dream endures—even when enhanced by digital twins and vast reasoning capacity. The human core must remain central which is also the core of Sovereign AI.</p><p><br></p><p>In its simplest terms, Sovereign AI is artificial intelligence systems which reflect ourselves and our values, our intelligence and functions on sovereign data platforms. This allows the human user to access, manage and control their data however they choose. Sovereign AI is the option that is available now and is in contrast to centralized control of data by others which is not designed to reflect the human user using artificial technology.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Risk Management - Key</strong></p><p>99.9% of people are good; only a small minority are not. If digital intelligence is monopolized and control completely ceded to third parties, we greatly increase the risks of harmful superintelligence outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p>To stay safe, systems must be designed from the bottom up, rooted in individual data and intelligence. Morality and values must be built in "by design," because every AI must be grounded in individual human intelligence. This is not about a "man in the loop," but ensuring Sovereign AI everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Big tech monopolists cannot dominate public trust. Trust needs transparency. That trust has long gone, perhaps never existed. The most important task is to establish Distributed Trust, with the new technology and infrastructure for human-centric AI. This is an enormous technological, financing and methodical task but must be done. This is not only important for individuals but global society and industry as well. All sectors, segments, companies are demanding this change since most feel utterly unsafe and puzzled how to handle their future under current circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>Until such exists, each responsible person must embrace "Do it yourself," support initiatives fostering Sovereign AI, and demand new guaranteed mechanisms to reclaim personal data for one's own use, provide new means to store safely and securely and generate sovereign intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Future generations' intelligence must remain free and under individual influence and control. Humanity's greatest ability is the freedom to dream and dream big. And dreaming is our most sovereign feature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Current Societies and Posthumanism – NoGo</strong></p><p>Today our societies function—imperfectly, but function nonetheless. They are human societies, where we connect to the "great and ultimate foundation model"—God, or what we perceive to be Creator of the Universe. This is right of humanity and the right of all humans. Posthumanist voices leading us elsewhere are misleading.</p><p><br></p><p>AI is a vast opportunity, yet like nuclear energy, it is dual—capable of good or harm. It depends on us what it becomes. We must safeguard thought freedom of human intelligence, and creative diversity as the sustainable drivers of progress.</p><p><br></p><p>We must build AI systems, sovereign networks, and regulatory frameworks that enshrine this "by new design," and pursue global agreements on AI use—especially in military domains, where responsibility is critical. This is a hard but unavoidable challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>These conversations must be kept free from just the traditional dominance of Western logic of human rights arguments and instead a broader right of all humanity and its diverse cultures, languages and history, so that we move not toward division but toward shared understanding and direction. In this matter, it is clear that the common interest of all humanity lies in the emergence of a unified, long-term sustainable technological and regulatory environment. Something entirely new.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Game Changing or Game Over</strong></p><p>We face danger. All this must be achieved before we reach the "point of no return." At today's pace, that point will arrive soon—we must act now.</p><p><br></p><p>The last time in history we had warnings of the devastation of the use of technology was from Hungarian Martians, Enrico Fermi and Albert Einstein and President Roosevelt who all launched the Manhattan Project to protect humanity from nuclear risk. We face a similar moment today.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the new Manhattan Project to Change the Game from a Game Over scenario for the future of AI technology to be a tool for humanity and not lead humans to become the tool of AI. From Mars—where Hungarians are said to come from—the Earth is visible, and it must remain so for a long time for humanity, with its own intelligence, to thrive even on galactic horizons.</p><p><br></p><p><em>By: Antal Kuthy &amp; Zoltan Papp</em></p>
