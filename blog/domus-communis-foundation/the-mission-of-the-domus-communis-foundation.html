        <div class="post-content">

                <p><strong>DCF</strong> was designed and is established as a global constellation of non-profits dedicated to the research, development, promotion, implementation, education, advocacy, and support of human-centric, ethical, safe, and secure cyber and AI technologies for the benefit of humankind, the preservation of peace, and the advancement of the common good.</p><p>The <strong>DCF Mission</strong> is being built by creating a global commons of experts, technologists, academics, researchers, regulators, governments, humanitarian organizations, faith leaders, companies, and people who care about the future of technology for the benefit of humanity. At the core is the belief that technology should be the tool of the human and that the human should not become the tool of technology.</p><p>Control of data, when it is shared, and how it is used by whoever creates their data and AI being used by a person or entity reflecting the identity of them and not in control of a third party is at the heart of the DCF Mission. This is the direction of data sovereignty and Sovereign AI opposed to the direction of third-party control for monetization purposes and a key to maintain technology as a tool for humans for common good.</p><p>Creating the global commons so that cyber and AI technology maintains the diversities and beliefs from cultures and faiths throughout the Global North, South, East, and West. The global commons design is so that community can grow together leaving no one behind and no digital divide. The global commons can bridge knowledge, information, resources and connect donors, experts, technologists, academicians, researchers, regulators, governments, humanitarian organizations, faith leaders, companies, and people to work together as technology continues to be built to be on the track for human good. DCF believes the global commons approach is a key to peace and human thriving and integral human development.</p><h3><strong>To achieve and sustain the DCF Mission, DCF has identified some key guiding principles:</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Human-Centric Technology for the Common Good</strong></p><p> Promote, encourage, and develop technologies, infrastructures, and ecosystems that enhance opportunities for humanity, reduce risks to humanity, and ensure that the sovereignty of intelligence, data, and decision-making remains with individuals and societies.</p><p><strong>2. Sovereign AI and Data Sovereignty</strong></p><p> Support the development, deployment, and maintenance of sovereign artificial intelligence systems, sovereign data platforms and infrastructures, cyber safety and security technology and platforms, and digital networks designed to provide the control by the individual or entity creating the data and to be shared as they choose in a trusted network.</p><p><strong>3. Global Peace, Safety, and Security</strong></p><p> Advance global peace, high-technology safety, nuclear disarmament, and the peaceful use of AI, cyber and related technologies; promote secure, value-aligned, and transparent technological ecosystems.</p><p><strong>4. Cross-Cultural and Multilateral Cooperation</strong></p><p> Act as a global meeting place for stakeholders from the Global North, South, East, and West — including donors, experts, technologists, academicians, researchers, faith leaders, governments, regulators, individuals, humanitarian organizations, and companies — to cooperate in advancing ethical and safe technologies and cyber and AI for humankind.</p><p><strong>5. Public Education and Awareness</strong></p><p> Inform and educate societies and individuals on the importance, use and development of safe, ethical, and human-centric technologies; highlight the risks and opportunities of advanced AI, cyber and related technologies; advocate for regulatory and industry alignment toward the common good.</p><p><strong>6. Empowering Future Generations</strong></p><p> Work with youth and educational institutions to provide and mentor the understanding of the importance of sovereign intelligence; technological sovereignty; and the preservation of human values, creativity, and freedom.</p><p><strong>7. Industry Engagement and Technological Alignment</strong></p><p> Collaborate with industries and individuals to develop action plans and digital infrastructures that enable sovereign and human-centric uses of AI, data, and next-generation technologies across key sectors, including life sciences, energy, robotics, data industries, the knowledge economy, big data, social media, and other technology-driven industries.</p><p><strong>8. Support of Aligned Initiatives</strong></p><p> Support Vatican, Catholic, inter-religious, secular, humanitarian, educational, and nonprofit projects, programs, operations, and infrastructures that align with the DCF Mission.</p><h3><strong>Why Does the DCF Mission Matter?</strong></h3><p>Cyber and AI technology development move at an extreme pace. Computing power and speed continues an explosive exponential growth. Humans continue to create massive amounts of data daily and provide it to AI. AI is constantly learning from all this new data. Data monetization is a large driver of AI technology programming. Value-based programming is slowly developing and data monetization can be inconsistent with value-based programming further slowing integration of values and sovereignty into cyber and AI technology development. The direction and speed of AI’s growth means that ethical, value-based, social, and legal frameworks are lagging behind. Wisdom, ethics, policies, regulation, and education must catch up and lead.</p><p>There are many individuals and groups working separately today. The need for common understanding and global interaction through knowledge and information sharing is necessary to keep up the speed of AI and its development.</p><p>There is a place and a need for everyone to engage with DCF and expand and grow the global commons across the Global North, South, East, and West. Researchers can connect with researchers, academicians can connect with academicians, donors, experts, technologists, academicians, researchers, regulators, governments, humanitarian organizations, faith leaders, companies, and people to work together as technology continues to be built to be on the track for human good. This will take everyone working together for humanity and the human common good.</p><p><strong>By: Zoltan Papp</strong></p>
