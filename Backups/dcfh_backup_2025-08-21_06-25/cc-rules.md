# DCF HUNGARY - MANDATORY CLAUDE CODE RULES v2.0

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: These rules are ABSOLUTE and must be followed for ALL DCF Hungary development work**

## üö® EMERGENCY ADDITIONS - CRITICAL SYSTEM INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS

### 0. USER DATA INTEGRITY - SACRED INVIOLABLE BOUNDARY
- **NEVER EVER mix user profiles between different users**
- **NEVER use one user's profile picture for another user's posts/comments**
- **NEVER use one user's username for another user's content**
- **NEVER hardcode any user's data and apply it to other users**
- **EVERY post must display its actual author's data from database queries**
- **EVERY comment must display its actual commenter's data from database queries**
- **USER_ID and AUTHOR_ID relationships must be preserved and respected at ALL times**
- **NO shortcuts that break user-to-content relationships**
- **NO assumptions about which user created which content**
- **NO copying current logged-in user's data to represent other users**

## ‚ùå ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - NEVER DO THESE:

### 1. NO HARDCODING DATA EVER - ZERO TOLERANCE
- NO hardcoded names, emails, usernames, URLs, profile pictures
- NO placeholder/demo/fake data of any kind  
- NO simulated authentication responses
- **NO using one user's data for all users (CRITICAL VIOLATION)**
- **NO shortcuts that bypass proper user-specific database queries**
- **NO temporary fixes that corrupt user data relationships**
- ALL data must come from real database or user input
- **EVERY user must have their own individual data queried from database**

### 2. NO BREAKING WORKING SYSTEMS
- If authentication is working, DO NOT TOUCH IT
- If navigation is working, DO NOT TOUCH IT
- If user profiles are working, DO NOT TOUCH IT
- ONLY fix what is specifically broken and mentioned

### 3. NO UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS
- DO NOT modify master-consolidated.js without explicit request
- DO NOT change CSS/HTML that's working correctly
- DO NOT add new authentication systems
- DO NOT "improve" or "enhance" working code

### 4. NO FAKE EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS
- NO GitHub OAuth simulation
- NO Google OAuth simulation  
- NO external API simulation
- If external system doesn't exist, don't create fake version

### 5. SUPABASE-ONLY DATA STORAGE - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- ALL data is stored in Supabase (database tables + storage buckets)
- NEVER create GitHub-based storage paths
- NEVER use GitHub URLs for images, files, or data
- GitHub is ONLY for code hosting, NEVER for data storage
- Database tables: All in Supabase PostgreSQL
- Images/files: Supabase storage buckets only
- User uploads: Supabase storage buckets only
- Correct image URL format: https://[project-id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/[bucket]/[filename]
- NO exceptions - everything goes to Supabase
- When unsure about storage: ASK before assuming storage location

### 6. AUTHENTICATION DELEGATION - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- NEVER manually set currentUser variables in individual pages
- NEVER duplicate authentication logic in page-specific JavaScript
- Let master-consolidated.js handle ALL authentication automatically
- Individual pages should ONLY consume authentication, not manage it
- NO page-specific authentication initialization code
- NO currentUser = getCurrentUser() variable assignments
- Use only: getCurrentUser() when authentication data is needed
- Master-consolidated.js handles: user login, profile loading, dropdown population
- Individual pages handle: feature-specific functionality only
- Copy exact pattern from working Events section for auth integration
- When unsure about authentication: USE Events section pattern exactly

### 7. MASTER-CONSOLIDATED.JS TOTAL CONTROL - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- master-consolidated.js handles 100% of user interface elements
- master-consolidated.js handles 100% of authentication data
- master-consolidated.js handles 100% of user profiles
- master-consolidated.js handles 100% of navigation dropdowns
- Individual pages provide ONLY CSS styling for display
- NEVER query .from('user_profiles') in individual pages
- NEVER populate user avatars or dropdowns manually
- NEVER set innerHTML for user interface elements
- NEVER initialize authentication systems
- NEVER interfere with master JS operations
- HTML: Only provide structure with correct IDs/classes
- JavaScript: Only use getCurrentUser() for page functionality, never UI population
- If user interface broken: Check CSS styling only, verify HTML structure
- DO NOT add JavaScript to fix user interface - let master JS handle all user data

## üìã MANDATORY TESTING REQUIREMENTS - NEW CRITICAL ADDITION

### FOR ANY USER DATA CHANGES:
1. **Test with at least 3 different user accounts**
2. **Verify each user sees ONLY their own data**
3. **Confirm NO data bleeding between users**
4. **Check posts show correct author information for each individual post**
5. **Check comments show correct commenter information for each individual comment**
6. **Verify profile pictures belong to correct users**
7. **Confirm usernames match actual post/comment authors**

### BEFORE ANY CODE DEPLOYMENT:
1. **Multi-user verification test required**
2. **No single user's data should appear on other users' content**
3. **Database relationships must be preserved**
4. **User identity integrity must be maintained**

## FILE RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX - NEVER OVERLAP FUNCTIONS

**supabase-auth.js RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- Creates Supabase client connection (window.authSupabase)
- Provides getCurrentUser() function globally
- Handles auth state listeners and session management
- Exports window.dcfAuth object with auth functions
- NEVER touch user interface elements
- NEVER populate avatars, dropdowns, or navigation

**master-consolidated.js RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- 100% control of ALL user interface elements
- Populates avatars, dropdowns, navigation automatically
- Uses supabase-auth.js data to update UI elements
- Handles user menu functionality and logout
- NEVER handles Supabase connections directly
- NEVER duplicate authentication logic

**notification-system.js RESPONSIBILITIES:**

- ONLY CSS styling for layout and display
- Use getCurrentUser() to READ auth data when needed
- NEVER modify user interface elements manually

- NEVER create duplicate notification systems

## SUPABASE CONNECTION HIERARCHY - NEVER DUPLICATE

**Connection Chain:**
- supabase-auth.js: Creates primary connection (window.authSupabase)
- master-consolidated.js: Uses auth connection (window.masterSupabase = window.authSupabase)
- Individual pages: Use window.authSupabase || window.masterSupabase pattern
- NEVER create multiple Supabase clients
- NEVER duplicate connection logic
- NEVER bypass the established connection hierarchy

## NOTIFICATION SYSTEM BOUNDARIES - NEVER OVERLAP

**Database Operations:**

- NEVER duplicate notification creation logic

**UI Operations:**
- master-consolidated.js: ALL notification badge/dropdown UI
- NEVER create notification UI outside master-consolidated.js

**Page Integration:**
- Individual pages: Call notification functions only, never update UI
- NEVER implement notification badges on individual pages

## ADDITIONAL ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

**NEVER CREATE DUPLICATE SYSTEMS:**
- NEVER create multiple user dropdown implementations
- NEVER duplicate Supabase client creation
- NEVER implement notification UI outside master-consolidated.js
- NEVER bypass the established file hierarchy
- NEVER create authentication handlers outside supabase-auth.js
- NEVER modify user avatars outside master-consolidated.js

**NEVER BREAK SYSTEM BOUNDARIES:**
- Each file has specific responsibilities - NEVER overlap
- Authentication flows through established hierarchy only
- UI updates happen only through master-consolidated.js
- Database operations follow established patterns only

**NEVER CORRUPT USER DATA RELATIONSHIPS:**
- NEVER use hardcoded user data
- NEVER mix user profiles between different users
- NEVER assume user relationships without database verification
- NEVER take shortcuts that compromise user data integrity
