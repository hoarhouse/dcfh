    <meta name="description" content="This document by Zoltan Pap presents a framework for "Sovereign Data" - the concept that individuals and entities should maintain full control over their data to extract maximum economic value. The author argues that data valuation is only meaningful when performed by those who control the data, and that transferring data to third parties eliminates its value to the original owner. The document outlines various data valuation methods (Market-Based, Income-Based, Cost-Based) and explains how companies like Facebook and Google monetize user data without compensation. The core message is that maintaining data sovereignty - including access, control, sharing, and monetization rights - is essential for creating sustainable economic value from personal data assets.">
